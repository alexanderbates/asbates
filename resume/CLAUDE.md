# CV Codebase Analysis

## CSS and RMD Relationship

The CV styling is controlled by two CSS files and their application to the index.Rmd structure:

### CSS Files Analysis

1. **dd_cv.css** (Base template styles):
   - Sets Montserrat as main font and Playfair Display for headers
   - Configures sidebar width (7rem) and background color
   - Handles timeline styling with decorator circles and lines
   - Controls spacing and layout of sections, details, and places
   - Manages skill bars and information cards

2. **custom.css** (Personal overrides):
   - Changes fonts (Lexend Deca for h1, Montserrat for h2/h3)
   - Sets earth tone color scheme (#DBCB9F for sidebar, #88816f for accents)
   - Controls link colors and hover effects
   - Adds page break controls with .break-after-me class
   - Overrides text sizes and spacing

### Key CSS-RMD Relationships

| CSS Class/Element | RMD Application | Visual Effect |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `.aside` | Sidebar content | Controls width (7rem), background color, text styling |
| `.main-block` | Main content sections | Formats content areas in the main column |
| `.section` | Section headers | Handles section headings with timeline connectors |
| `.decorator` | Timeline elements | Styles timeline circles and connecting lines |
| `.details` | Content descriptions | Controls text in timeline entries and descriptions |
| `.place` | Institution names | Formats workplace and institution entries |
| `.blocks` | Content grouping | Controls spacing and layout of content blocks |

## Current CV Formatting Issues (Updated Analysis)

### Spacing and Alignment Issues
1. **Sidebar alignment**
   - Sidebar content starts too low compared to main content
   - Excessive vertical padding at the top of the sidebar
   - Poor alignment with main content headings

2. **Line spacing improvements needed**
   - Current line-height of 1.15 is better but could be optimized further
   - Bullet points need slightly more vertical separation
   - Content appears somewhat cramped in detailed lists

3. **Section spacing refinement**
   - Major sections (PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH, EDUCATION) still have slightly too much spacing
   - Timeline entries need more consistent spacing
   - Need better vertical rhythm throughout document

### Text Size Hierarchy
1. **Title text issues**
   - Non-main titles are still slightly too large (0.6rem)
   - Timeline titles (0.52rem) need better visual hierarchy
   - Need clearer differentiation between section titles and content

2. **Table text readability**
   - Publication tables still have compressed text (0.45rem)
   - Need better balance between space efficiency and readability
   - Citation metrics need better visual distinction

3. **Timeline visualization**
   - Timeline dots (8px) blend with content
   - Need better visual emphasis for timeline connectors
   - More consistent alignment of date entries needed

### Current Visual Structure Problems
1. **Content differentiation**
   - Need better visual cues to distinguish content types
   - Employment dates and locations need more emphasis
   - Need clearer hierarchy between different entry types

2. **Section header balance**
   - Section headers (0.6rem) still slightly oversized relative to content
   - Need better vertical spacing before/after headers
   - Font weight makes headers stand out too much

3. **Sidebar formatting**
   - Skills section text is difficult to read at 0.5rem
   - Contact information appears compressed
   - Need better spacing between sidebar sections

## Technical Style Problems (Updated)

1. **CSS specificity conflicts**
   - Still using many !important flags (necessary but indicates structure issues)
   - Competing style rules between dd_cv.css and custom.css
   - Targeting of specific elements could be more efficient

2. **Font size implementation**
   - Global * selector sets base size but conflicts with specific element sizes
   - Inconsistent use of relative units (rem, em)

3. **Layout technique issues**
   - Heavy reliance on fixed margins rather than flexible spacing
   - Limited use of container-based spacing

## Recent Improvements Made

1. **Reduced section title sizes**
   - Reduced h2 size from 0.65rem to 0.6rem
   - Improved timeline title size from 0.48rem to 0.52rem
   - Added font-weight:500 to timeline titles for better emphasis

2. **Improved table formatting**
   - Increased main table font size from 0.4rem to 0.45rem
   - Increased cell padding from 0.02/0.04rem to 0.04/0.06rem
   - Improved line height from 1.1 to 1.15 for better readability

3. **Fixed sidebar alignment**
   - Removed unnecessary breaks in Rmd file
   - Removed top margin/padding from sidebar elements
   - Improved first section alignment in sidebar

4. **Added proper eye icon**
   - Updated Peer Reviews section icon from chalkboard-teacher to eye
   - Better semantic representation of the content

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Further refine spacing**
   - Consider increasing line-height to 1.2 for optimal readability
   - Add slight padding between bullet points
   - Create more consistent vertical rhythm

2. **Improve visual hierarchy**
   - Further adjust section header (h2) size or weight
   - Enhance timeline visualization with better connector styling
   - Create clearer visual distinction between entry types

3. **Optimize table formatting**
   - Continue refining publication table readability
   - Consider adding subtle alternating row styling
   - Enhance citation metric visual presentation

4. **Sidebar improvements**
   - Further refine sidebar spacing and alignment
   - Consider adjusting sidebar width or padding
   - Improve contrast and readability of sidebar content

   - Reduced vertical space between list items and paragraphs
   - Created tighter line heights (1.1) throughout for better space efficiency

2. **Enhanced Text Hierarchy**
   - Reduced size of location and date text to 0.42rem
   - Decreased opacity for secondary information (dates, locations) to 0.85
   - Balanced font sizes across different content types
   - Improved contrast between section headers and content

3. **Sidebar Alignment**
   - Left-aligned sidebar content

## Content Analysis and Issues

### Language and Consistency
1. **US/UK English Mixing**
   - Inconsistent spelling conventions ("organization" vs. "organisation")
   - Mixing of "centre" (UK) and "center" (US)
   - UK-centric terminology like "1st class degree" without explanation

2. **Formatting Inconsistencies**
   - Email address links have incorrect markdown format
   - Inconsistent use of Oxford comma in lists
   - Varying capitalization patterns for technical terms
   - Inconsistent abbreviation of journal names

3. **Content Clarity Issues**
   - Introduction is somewhat informal for a professional CV
   - Inclusion of date of birth (unnecessary for professional context)
   - Some vague descriptions ("helping to lead" instead of specific roles)
   - Scientific terminology inconsistencies (e.g., "Drosophila Melanogaster" instead of "Drosophila melanogaster")

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Structure
1. **CSS File Organization**
   - **dd_cv.css**: Base template with core layout and timeline structure
   - **custom.css**: Personal overrides with section-specific commenting
   - Clear separation of concerns with detailed documentation

2. **Effective Selector Hierarchy**
   - Strategic use of specificity to target precise elements
   - Well-organized sections for different CV components
   - Detailed commenting for maintainability

3. **Responsive Design Elements**
   - Relative units (rem) used consistently
   - Flexbox layout for sidebar components
   - Print-specific styling for PDF output

## Recommended Improvements

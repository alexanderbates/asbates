# Media Coverage and Public Impact - Dr. Alexander Shakeel Bates

This document provides a comprehensive overview of media attention and
public engagement related to major connectomics research projects,
demonstrating significant impact beyond the scientific community and
recognition for contributions to neuroscience.

## BBC Science Breakthrough of 2024

**The FAFB (Full Adult Fly Brain) brain mapping project was named one of
the top scientific breakthroughs of 2024 by the BBC.**

In December 2024, the BBC recognized the first complete map of an adult
fly brain as one of the year's most significant scientific achievements.
This landmark recognition by one of the world's most respected
broadcasters highlights the transformative impact of connectomics
research on our understanding of brain function. The FAFB project, to
which Dr. Alexander Bates contributed extensively over nearly a decade
(2015-2025), represents the most detailed brain map ever created,
documenting every neuron and synapse in an adult animal's nervous
system.

## Research Background and Leadership

Throughout his career, Dr. Alexander Bates has participated in three
landmark connectomics projects that have generated substantial
international media attention. The major projects and their media
coverage are described below:

**FAFB (Full Adult Fly Brain) / FlyWire Project (2017-2024)** -
Contributing scientist in the reconstruction of the first complete adult
fly brain connectome. This international collaboration produced one of
the most comprehensive neuroscience datasets ever created, receiving
extensive media coverage across major international outlets including
The Guardian, The New York Times, NPR, BBC, Scientific American, and
WIRED. This work was recognized as **BBC Science of the Year 2024**.

**Note:** Dr. Alexander Bates's large and instrumental contributions to
FAFB projects spanning almost 10 years (2015-2025) are clearly marked
throughout his Publications section, where FAFB projects are identified.
These contributions include 10 major publications in premier journals
(Nature, Cell, Neuron, Current Biology) demonstrating sustained,
impactful work on this landmark project that achieved the first complete
adult animal brain map.

**HemiBrain Project (2019-2020)** - Core team member at Janelia Research
Campus working on the hemibrain connectome reconstruction. This project
established new standards for connectome analysis and generated
significant media interest in the computational neuroscience community.

**BANC (Brain and Nerve Cord) Project (2020-present)** - **Co-leading
scientist** coordinating the first complete synaptic-resolution
connectome of an adult Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord. As
co-lead, Dr. Alexander Bates directs the project's scientific strategy,
coordinates international collaborators, and serves as a spokesperson
for the work. This project represents the culmination of decades of
connectomics research. Video presentation:

This comprehensive feature article demonstrates the transformative
global impact of the FlyWire FAFB project one year after publication.
The article showcases how this complete connectome resource has
fundamentally accelerated research productivity and sparked
collaborative opportunities across the international neuroscience
community.

**Wide-Ranging Impact Across Research Domains:** The article documents
FlyWire's influence through interviews with eleven leading
neuroscientists from premier institutions worldwide, demonstrating
applications across multiple research areas: - **Taste processing:**
Identification of taste pathways previously unknown for decades -
**Social behavior circuits:** Novel mechanisms regulating fly social
interactions - **Motor control and flight navigation:** Discovery of
visual-to-direction transformations via central complex pathways -
**Courtship behavior:** Dopamine's role as a sensory filter during
mating (Rezaval lab discovery) - **Head direction representation:**
Confirmation of ring attractor network predictions - **Educational
applications:** Integration into undergraduate neuroscience curricula

**Scientists Quoted and Their Affiliations:** The article features
expert commentary from researchers at institutions spanning four
continents: - **Dr. Mala Murthy** - Princeton University (FlyWire
co-lead) - **Dr. H. Sebastian Seung** - Princeton University (FlyWire
co-lead) - **Dr. Anita Devineni** - Emory University (taste processing

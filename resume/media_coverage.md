## Research Background and Leadership

Throughout my career, I have participated in three landmark connectomics projects that have generated substantial international media attention:

**FAFB (Full Adult Fly Brain) / FlyWire Project (2017-2024)** - Contributing scientist in the reconstruction of the first complete adult fly brain connectome. This international collaboration produced one of the most comprehensive neuroscience datasets ever created, receiving extensive media coverage across major international outlets including The Guardian, The New York Times, NPR, BBC, Scientific American, and WIRED. This work was recognized as **BBC Science of the Year 2024**.

**Note:** My large and instrumental contributions to FAFB projects spanning almost 10 years (2018-2025) are clearly marked throughout my Publications section, where FAFB projects are identified. These contributions include 10 major publications in premier journals (Nature, Cell, Neuron, Current Biology) demonstrating sustained, impactful work on this landmark project that achieved the first complete adult animal brain map.

**HemiBrain Project (2019-2020)** - Core team member at Janelia Research Campus working on the hemibrain connectome reconstruction. This project established new standards for connectome analysis and generated significant media interest in the computational neuroscience community.

**BANC (Brain and Nerve Cord) Project (2020-present)** - **Co-leading scientist** coordinating the first complete synaptic-resolution connectome of an adult Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord. As co-lead, I direct the project's scientific strategy, coordinate international collaborators, and serve as a spokesperson for the work. This project represents the culmination of decades of connectomics research. Video presentation: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZOWtTs4Zgc&t=1s)

These projects have collectively reached millions of people worldwide, translating complex neuroscience into accessible stories that inspire public understanding of brain function.

## Personal Recognition in Media

My contributions have been specifically recognized in several high-profile media pieces:

**Individual Recognition:**
- **Named contributor** in "An Interactive, Automated 3D Reconstruction of a Fly Brain" - highlighting my role in developing novel analysis methods
- **Featured profile** in "Humans of HBI" (Harvard Brain Initiative) - personal story highlighting my research journey and approach to collaborative science
- **Highlighted by UCL** (University College London) in alumni feature - recognition of my undergraduate achievements and subsequent career trajectory
- **Named in MRC LMB** feature on neurotransmitter mapping - specific recognition for contributions to transmitter prediction algorithms
- **Quoted in The Transmitter** - providing expert commentary on connectomics methodology and its implications for neuroscience

**Skills Beyond Neuroscience:**
In a TBR News Media article on cancer clinical trial research led by Dr. Hassal Lee (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), I was highlighted for my computational expertise beyond neuroscience. While conducting my own neuroscience research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, I provided coding assistance to Dr. Lee for her large-scale data analysis work on cancer clinical trial accessibility. Dr. Lee described me as a "program whiz kid," emphasizing my technical programming skills and ability to work across disciplines - demonstrating expertise in computational biology, data science, and collaborative problem-solving that extends well beyond traditional neuroscience.

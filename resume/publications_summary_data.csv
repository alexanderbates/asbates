"Distributed control circuits across a brain-and-cord connectome","AS Bates, JS Phelps, M Kim, HH Yang, A Matsliah, Z Ajabi, E Perlman, ...","bioRxiv, in review at Nature","",2025,10,"TFP_iSt0sucC","The first complete adult fly connectome uniting brain and ventral nerve cord reveals that motor control is organized through local sensory-motor feedback loops within body segments, which are coordinated by long-range ascending and descending neurons arranged into behavior-centric modules. This distributed, hierarchical architecture shows that brain regions supporting learning and navigation supervise lower-level circuits, enabling flies to coordinate complex behaviors like flight and walking while maintaining rapid sensory responsiveness."
"Neural circuit mechanisms for steering control in walking Drosophila","A Rayshubskiy, SL Holtz, AS Bates, QX Vanderbeck, LS Capdevila, ...","eLife","13, RP102230",2025,100,"iH-uZ7U-co4C","Two specialized descending neuron types control steering at different timescales during walking: DNa01 mediates sustained low-gain steering while DNa02 produces rapid high-gain turns by integrating head direction signals with multimodal sensory inputs. These neurons operate through a 'see-saw' organizational principle where excitation of one brain hemisphere's descending neuron is paired with inhibition of the opposite side, enabling precise bilateral coordination of turning movements."

Sexual dimorphism is concentrated in reproductive circuits, with 1% of descending and 4% of ascending neurons showing sex-specific connectivity patterns that support courtship song production in males and reproductive behaviors in females."
"Sexual dimorphism in the complete connectome of the Drosophila male central nervous system","S Berg, IR Beckett, M Costa, P Schlegel, M Januszewski, EC Marin, ...","bioRxiv","2025.10. 09.680999",2025,3,"maZDTaKrznsC","The first complete male Drosophila central nervous system connectome (166,000+ neurons) reveals 262 sex-specific and 114 sexually dimorphic cell types comprising 4.8% of the central brain, concentrated in higher-order brain centers while sensory and motor periphery remain largely isomorphic. Although dimorphic neurons represent a small fraction of total neurons, sexual dimorphism propagates through the nervous system via dimorphic connectivity patterns, providing the neural substrate for behavioral differences between males and females in mating and aggression."

## Expert Commentary in Trade Journals

### 1. The Transmitter: Neuroscience News and Perspectives

**Article:** "Cross-species connectome comparison shows uneven olfactory circuit evolution in flies" | **Publication:** The Transmitter (Simons Foundation) | **Date:** 1 August 2025 | **Role:** Independent expert commentator

Dr. Alexander Bates was quoted as an independent expert providing critical commentary on a preprint by Roberts et al. (2025) comparing Drosophila connectomes across species. Though Dr. Bates has worked with the authors previously, he was not significantly involved in this project. The Transmitter approached him to provide professional judgment on the methodology and conclusions. His commentary highlighted critical limitations in sample size and statistical power, noting that conclusions based on just two connectomes cannot distinguish species-level from individual-level variation, and emphasized the need for rigorous experimental comparisons with better statistical power in future work.

Being approached by The Transmitter (a highly respected neuroscience publication supported by the Simons Foundation) for independent expert commentary demonstrates recognition as an authority in connectomics methodology and represents standing in judgment of others' work through professional expert commentary to the neuroscience community.

## Scientific Journalism and Public Communication

### 1. New Scientist: Synthesizing Research for Public Audiences

**Articles:** "Why are so many Labradors fat?" (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086840-why-are-so-many-labradors-fat/) and "Twins' close bond makes them more likely to live to retirement" (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2088928-twins-close-bond-makes-them-more-likely-to-live-to-retirement/)

Dr. Alexander Bates contributed science journalism to New Scientist, one of the world's most respected and widely-read popular science magazines (weekly circulation ~125,000; digital reach in millions). Founded in 1956, New Scientist has established itself as the leading international science publication for general audiences, bridging cutting-edge research and public understanding. In these articles, Dr. Bates judged, synthesized, and communicated the work of other researchers for public audiences, evaluating research findings on canine genetics and twin longevity studies, and translating complex scientific concepts into accessible narratives. This work demonstrates his ability to critically assess scientific literature across diverse fields, distill key findings, and communicate them effectively to non-specialist audiences—skills directly relevant to standing in judgment of scientific quality and significance for broader communication and education purposes.

**Role Invited:** Guest Editor
**Status:** Invitation received but declined

**Guest Editor Responsibilities (as outlined in invitation):**
- Setting the scope and direction of the Special Issue
- Inviting contributions from leading researchers in the field
- Overseeing the peer review process for submitted manuscripts
- Making editorial decisions (accept/revise/reject) based on peer reviews
- Ensuring scientific quality and coherence of the published collection
- Writing editorial introduction to the Special Issue

**Significance:** Guest Editors are selected based on demonstrated expertise and standing in their field. The role requires standing in judgment of multiple manuscripts, coordinating peer review, and making final editorial decisions on publication. Though this invitation was declined due to time constraints, it demonstrates recognition as a leader in insect neurobiology with the expertise required to judge and curate a collection of scientific work in the field.

Editorial responsibilities would have involved evaluating submissions from international research groups, selecting appropriate peer reviewers, synthesizing reviewer comments, and making final judgments on scientific quality and suitability for publication. This represents a higher level of editorial judgment than standard peer review, as Guest Editors are responsible for the overall quality and coherence of an entire Special Issue.

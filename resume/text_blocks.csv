intro,"I am a neuroscientist and computational biologist specialising in neuroanatomy and connectomics of the insect brain. My research focuses on understanding how neural circuits wire together to generate complex, innate behaviours. I develop open-source tools for neuroanatomical analysis and collaborate internationally on connectomics projects."

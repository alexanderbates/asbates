intro,"I am a neuroscientist and computational biologist specialising in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and connectomics of the insect brain. My research focuses on understanding how neural circuits wire and fire to generate complex behaviours, including olfactory processing and animal navigation. I develop open-source tools for neuroanatomical analysis and collaborate internationally on connectomics projects. In the wetlab, I use virtual reality and calcium imaging experiments to interrogate neurobiological circuits in living, behaving flies. I am a UK citizen."

```{r wordcloud, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.width = 1500, fid.height = 1500}
library(PubMedWordcloud)
pmids1 = getPMIDs(author = "Alexander Shakeel Bates", dFrom = 2007, dTo = 2050, n = 100)
pmids2 = getPMIDs(author = "Alexander S Bates", dFrom = 2007, dTo = 2050, n = 100)
pmids = union(pmids1,pmids2)
abstracts = getAbstracts(pmids)
cleanAbs = invisible(cleanAbstracts(abstracts))
plotWordCloud(cleanAbs)
```

Maybe a quick way to view my interests. Here is a word cloud from the abstracts of my published work.

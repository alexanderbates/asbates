> "THE most obvious differences between different animals are differences 
of size, but for some reason the zoologists have paid singularly little 
attention to them. In a large textbook of zoology before me I find no 
indication that the eagle is larger than the sparrow, or the hippopotamus 
bigger than the hare, though some grudging admissions are made in the case 
of the mouse and the whale. But yet it is easy to show that a hare could not 
be as large as a hippopotamus, or a while as small as a herring. For every 
type of animal there is a most convenient size, and a large change in size 
inevitably carries with it a change of form."
([J.B.S. Haldane](https://archive.org/stream/OnBeingTheRightSize-J.B.S.Haldane/rightsize_djvu.txt))

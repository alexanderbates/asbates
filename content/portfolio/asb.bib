              primary somatosensory (S1) and primary visual (V1) cortices of
              the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) as revealed
              by Golgi impregnation. Sirenians, including manatees, have an
              aquatic lifestyle, a large body size, and a relatively large
              lissencephalic brain. The present study examines neuron
              morphology in 3 cortical areas: in S1, dorsolateral cortex area 1
              (DL1) and cluster cortex area 2 (CL2) and in V1, dorsolateral
              cortex area 4 (DL4). Neurons exhibited a variety of morphological
              types, with pyramidal neurons being the most common. The large
              variety of neuron types present in the manatee cortex was
              comparable to that seen in other eutherian mammals, except for
              rodents and primates, where pyramid-shaped neurons predominate. A
              comparison between pyramidal neurons in S1 and V1 indicated
              relatively greater dendritic branching in S1. Across all 3 areas,
              the dendritic arborization pattern of pyramidal neurons was also
              similar to that observed previously in the afrotherian rock
              hyrax, cetartiodactyls, opossums, and echidnas but did not
              resemble the widely bifurcated dendrites seen in the
              large-brained African elephant. Despite adaptations for an
              aquatic environment, manatees did not share specific neuron types
              such as tritufted and star-like neurons that have been found in
              cetaceans. Manatees exhibit an evolutionarily primitive pattern
              of cortical neuron morphology shared with most other mammals and
              do not appear to have neuronal specializations for an aquatic
              niche.",

               However, in no system have aggression pheromones, their cognate
               receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified.
               Here we show that 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-specific
               volatile pheromone, robustly promotes male-male aggression in
               the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. The
               aggression-promoting effect of synthetic cVA requires olfactory
               sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the receptor Or67d, as well as
               the receptor itself. Activation of Or67d-expressing OSNs, either
               by genetic manipulation of their excitability or by exposure to
               male pheromones in the absence of other classes of OSNs, is
               sufficient to promote aggression. High densities of male flies
               can promote aggression by the release of volatile cVA. In turn,
               cVA-promoted aggression can promote male fly dispersal from a
               food resource, in a manner dependent on Or67d-expressing OSNs.
               These data indicate that cVA may mediate negative-feedback
               control of male population density, through its effect on
               aggression. Identification of a pheromone-OSN pair controlling

              for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
              algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
              largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
              arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
              communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the
              algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe
              that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to
              16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the
              Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
              communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we

              Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden
              algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find
              that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm

              odorants that elicit robust attraction responses and the neuronal
              circuits that mediate this behavior have not been identified.
              Here, we describe a functionally segregated population of
              olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs) in
              Drosophila melanogaster that are highly specific to ammonia and
              amines, which act as potent attractants. The OSNs express IR92a,
              a member of the chemosensory ionotropic receptor (IR) family and
              project to a pair of glomeruli in the antennal lobe, termed VM1.
              In vivo calcium-imaging experiments showed that the OSNs and PNs
              innervating VM1 were activated by ammonia and amines but not by
              nonamine odorants. Flies in which the IR92a(+) neurons or IR92a

              horn are topographically segregated from those of V-PN and
              DC4-PN, which mediate innate avoidance behavior to carbon dioxide
              and acidity, respectively, suggesting that these sensory stimuli
              of opposing valence are represented in spatially distinct
              neuroanatomic loci within the lateral horn. These experiments
              identified the neurons and their cognate receptor for amine
              detection, and mapped amine attractive olfactory inputs to higher

              quantified the percentage of the cells that produce or receive

              antennocerebral tract (mACT) projection neurons and two types of
              local neurons. Among them, mACT neurons had few presynaptic sites
              in the antennal lobe, making the local neurons essentially the
              sole provider of GABA signals there. On the other hand, not only
              these local neurons but also all types of projection neurons
              expressed both ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors. Thus,
              even though inhibitory signals are released from only a few,
              specific types of local neurons, the signals are read by most of
              the neurons in the antennal lobe neural circuitry.",

              inhibition, and encoding preferences for innately meaningful
              odors. Yet relatively little is known of the structure and
              function of LH neurons (LHNs), making it difficult to evaluate

              in the antennal lobe where the olfactory receptor neurons
              interact with projection neurons and local interneurons in a
              complex sensory processing circuitry. While several studies have
              addressed the developmental mechanisms involved in specification
              and connectivity of olfactory receptor neurons and projection
              neurons in Drosophila, the local interneurons are far less well
              understood. RESULTS: In this study, we use genetic marking
              techniques combined with antibody labelling and neuroblast
              ablation to analyse lineage specific aspects of local interneuron
              development. We find that a large set of local interneurons
              labelled by the GAL4-LN1 (NP1227) and GAL4-LN2 (NP2426) lines
              arise from the lateral neuroblast, which has also been shown to
              generate uniglomerular projection neurons. Moreover, we find that
              a remarkable diversity of local interneuron cell types with
              different glomerular innervation patterns and neurotransmitter
              expression derives from this lineage. We analyse the birth order
              of these two distinct neuronal types by generating MARCM (mosaic
              analysis with a repressible cell marker) clones at different
              times during larval life. This analysis shows that local
              interneurons arise throughout the proliferative cycle of the
              lateral neuroblast beginning in the embryo, while uniglomerular
              projection neurons arise later during the second larval instar.
              The lateral neuroblast requires the function of the cephalic gap
              gene empty spiracles for the development of olfactory
              interneurons. In empty spiracles null mutant clones, most of the
              local interneurons and lateral projection neurons are lacking.
              These findings reveal similarities in the development of local
              interneurons and projection neurons in the olfactory system of
              Drosophila. CONCLUSION: We find that the lateral neuroblast of
              the deutocerebrum gives rise to a large and remarkably diverse
              set of local interneurons as well as to projection neurons in the
              antennal lobe. Moreover, we show that specific combinations of
              these two neuron types are produced in specific time windows in
              this neuroblast lineage. The development of both these cell types
              in this lineage requires the function of the empty spiracles

              mate, and oviposit on food, they perceive the pheromone as a
              blend against a background of food odors. Previous studies have
              reported that food odors enhance flies' behavioral response to
              cVA, specifically in virgin females. However, how and where the
              different olfactory inputs interact has so far remained unknown.
              In this study, we elucidated the neuronal mechanism underlying
              the response at an anatomical, functional, and behavioral level.
              Our data show that in virgin females cVA and the complex food
              odor vinegar evoke a synergistic response in the cVA-responsive
              glomerulus DA1. This synergism, however, does not appear at the
              input level of the glomerulus, but is restricted to the
              projection neuron level only. Notably, it is abolished by a

              the various chemical features of an odor. We investigated where

              We exploited the unique morphology of neurons in the Drosophila
              mushroom body, which receive input on large dendritic claws.
              Imaging odor responses of these dendritic claws revealed that
              input channels with distinct odor tuning converge on individual
              mushroom body neurons. We determined how these inputs interact to
              drive the cell to spike threshold using intracellular recordings

              predominant modalities are a sweet-sensing pathway that mediates
              attraction, and a bitter-sensing pathway that mediates avoidance.
              A central question is how flies integrate stimuli from these
              pathways and generate the appropriate behavioral response. We
              have developed a novel assay for induction of taste memories. We
              demonstrate that the gustatory response to fructose is suppressed
              when followed by the presence of bitter quinine. We employ
              optogenetic neural activation using infrared laser in combination
              with heat-sensitive channel - TRPA1 to precisely activate
              gustatory neurons. This optogenetic system allows for spatially
              and temporally controlled activation of distinct neural classes
              in the gustatory circuit. We directly activated bitter-sensing
              neurons together with presentation of fructose for remote
              induction of aversive taste memories. Here we report that
              activation of bitter-sensing neurons in the proboscis suffices as
              a conditioning stimulus. Spatially restricted stimulation
              indicates that the conditioning stimulus is indeed a signal from
              the bitter neurons in the proboscis and it is independent of
              postingestive feedback. The coincidence of temporally specific
              activation of bitter-sensing neurons with fructose presentation
              is crucial for memory formation, establishing aversive taste
              learning in Drosophila as associative learning. Taken together,
              this optogenetic system provides a powerful new tool for
              interrogation of the central brain circuits that mediate memory

              stimuli are represented in sparse, stimulus-specific activity
              patterns, relatively little is known about sensory coding on the
              descending side of neural circuits, as a network converges. In
              insects, mushroom bodies have been an important model system for
              studying sparse coding in the olfactory system, where this format
              is important for accurate memory formation. In Drosophila, it has
              recently been shown that the 2,000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom
              body converge onto a population of only 34 mushroom body output
              neurons (MBONs), which fall into 21 anatomically distinct cell
              types. Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive
              view of olfactory representations at the fourth layer of the
              circuit, where we find a clear transition in the principles of
              sensory coding. We show that MBON tuning curves are highly
              correlated with one another. This is in sharp contrast to the
              process of progressive decorrelation of tuning in the earlier
              layers of the circuit. Instead, at the population level, odour
              representations are reformatted so that positive and negative
              correlations arise between representations of different odours.
              At the single-cell level, we show that uniquely identifiable
              MBONs display profoundly different tuning across different
              animals, but that tuning of the same neuron across the two
              hemispheres of an individual fly was nearly identical. Thus,
              individualized coordination of tuning arises at this level of the
              olfactory circuit. Furthermore, we find that this
              individualization is an active process that requires a
              learning-related gene, rutabaga. Ultimately, neural circuits have
              to flexibly map highly stimulus-specific information in sparse
              layers onto a limited number of different motor outputs. The
              reformatting of sensory representations we observe here may mark
              the beginning of this sensory-motor transition in the olfactory

              fecal samples from mammals native to the putative Southeast

              response to air currents delivered at speeds normally encountered

              organ, an antennal mechanosensory structure previously implicated
              in near-field sound detection (reviewed in refs 5 and 6). Using
              enhancer trap lines targeted to different subsets of Johnston's
              organ neurons, and a genetically encoded calcium indicator, we
              show that wind and near-field sound (courtship song) activate
              distinct populations of Johnston's organ neurons, which project
              to different regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor
              centre in the central brain. Selective genetic ablation of
              wind-sensitive Johnston's organ neurons in the antenna abolishes
              wind-induced suppression of locomotion behaviour, without
              impairing hearing. Moreover, different neuronal subsets within
              the wind-sensitive population respond to different directions of
              arista deflection caused by air flow and project to different
              regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor centre,
              providing a rudimentary map of wind direction in the brain.
              Importantly, sound- and wind-sensitive Johnston's organ neurons
              exhibit different intrinsic response properties: the former are
              phasically activated by small, bi-directional, displacements of
              the aristae, whereas the latter are tonically activated by
              unidirectional, static deflections of larger magnitude. These
              different intrinsic properties are well suited to the detection
              of oscillatory pulses of near-field sound and laminar air flow,
              respectively. These data identify wind-sensitive neurons in
              Johnston's organ, a structure that has been primarily associated

              the dawn of neuroscience, and yet, it is hard to synthesize them.
              Current algorithms typically define a growth process with
              parameters that allow matching aspects of the morphologies.
              However, such algorithmic growth processes are far simpler than
              the biological ones. What is needed is an algorithm that, given a
              database of morphologies, produces more of those. Here, we
              introduce a generator for neuron morphologies that is based on a
              statistical sampling process. Our Reversible Jump Markov chain
              Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method starts with a trivial neuron and
              iteratively perturbs the morphology bringing the features close
              to those of the database. By quantifying the statistics of the
              generated neurons, we find that it outperforms growth-based
              models for many features. Good generative models for neuron
              morphologies promise to be important both for neural simulations
              and for morphology reconstructions from imaging data.",

              map the tuning properties of Johnston's organ neurons (JONs) at
              the site where their axons enter the brain. We then applied the
              same methodology to study two key brain regions that process
              signals from JONs: the antennal mechanosensory and motor center
              (AMMC) and the wedge, which is downstream of the AMMC. First, we
              identified a diversity of JON response types that tile frequency
              space and form a rough tonotopic map. Some JON response types are
              direction selective; others are specialized to encode amplitude
              modulations over a specific range (dynamic range fractionation).
              Next, we discovered that both the AMMC and the wedge contain a
              tonotopic map, with a significant increase in tonotopy-and a
              narrowing of frequency tuning-at the level of the wedge. Whereas
              the AMMC tonotopic map is unilateral, the wedge tonotopic map is
              bilateral. Finally, we identified a subregion of the AMMC/wedge
              that responds preferentially to the coherent rotation of the two
              mechanical organs in the same angular direction, indicative of
              oriented steady air flow (directional wind). Together, these maps

              sequences of transcription factors (TFs) have been found to be
              sequentially expressed in NBs of two different systems: the
              Hunchback, Kr{\"u}ppel, Pdm1/Pdm2, Castor, and Grainyhead

              neural precursors by sequences of TFs is a common theme to
              generate neural diversity. Cross-regulations, including negative
              feedback regulation and positive feedforward regulation among the
              temporal factors, can facilitate the progression of the sequence.
              However, there are many remaining questions to understand the
              mechanism of temporal transitions. The temporal sequence
              progression is intimately linked to the progressive restriction
              of NB competence, and eventually determines the end of
              neurogenesis. Temporal identity has to be integrated with spatial

              transformations followed by iterative nonrigid registrations, and
              the Virtual Insect Brain (VIB) protocol by using global and local
              rigid transformations followed by local nonrigid transformations.
              Both methods generated a standard brain, but for different
              applications. Whereas the VIB technique was designed to visualize
              anatomical variability between the input brains, the purpose of
              the ISA method was the opposite, i.e., to remove this
              variability. A novel individually labeled neuron, connecting the
              lobula to the midbrain and deutocerebrum, has been registered
              into the ISA atlas and demonstrates its usefulness and accuracy
              for future analysis of neural networks. The locust standard brain

               odorant receptors (ORs): a divergent member of the OR family and
               the highly conserved, broadly expressed receptor OR83b. OR83b is
               essential for olfaction in vivo and enhances OR function in
               vitro, but the molecular mechanism by which it acts is unknown.
               Here we demonstrate that OR83b heterodimerizes with conventional
               ORs early in the endomembrane system in OSNs, couples these
               complexes to the conserved ciliary trafficking pathway, and is
               essential to maintain the OR/OR83b complex within the sensory
               cilia, where odor signal transduction occurs. The OR/OR83b
               complex is necessary and sufficient to promote functional
               reconstitution of odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons that
               normally respond only to carbon dioxide. Unexpectedly, unlike
               all known vertebrate and nematode chemosensory receptors, we
               find that Drosophila ORs and OR83b adopt a novel membrane
               topology with their N-termini and the most conserved loops in
               the cytoplasm. These loops mediate direct association of ORs
               with OR83b. Our results reveal that OR83b is a universal and
               integral part of the functional OR in Drosophila. This atypical
               heteromeric and topological design appears to be an
               insect-specific solution for odor recognition, making the

              depolarizing, inhibitory synaptic inputs. The afferent spikes are
              therefore superimposed on these depolarizing IPSPs, which are
              generated indirectly by other afferents from the same organ that
              respond to the same movement. Each afferent spikes preferentially
              to particular features of a joint movement, and its synaptic
              input is typically greatest at the joint position or during the
              movement that generates its best response. Afferents that respond
              to only one direction of movement receive synaptic inputs either
              during movements in both directions, or only during movements in
              their preferred direction. Phasic velocity-sensitive afferents
              receive either phasic inputs during movements, or tonic inputs at

              spikes by 12-28\%, and this is accompanied by a reduction of up
              to 50\% in the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSPs evoked by an

              Upon arrival in the MB, sensory information undergoes a profound
              transformation. Olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the main MB
              input, exhibit broadly tuned, sustained, and stereotyped
              responses to odorants; in contrast, their postsynaptic targets in
              the MB, the Kenyon cells (KCs), are nonstereotyped, narrowly
              tuned, and only briefly responsive to odorants. Theory and
              experiment have suggested that this transformation is implemented
              by random connectivity between KCs and PNs. However, this
              hypothesis has been challenging to test, given the difficulty of
              mapping synaptic connections between large numbers of neurons to
              achieve a unified view of neuronal network structure. Here we
              used a recent whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume of the
              adult fruit fly to map large numbers of PN-to-KC connections at
              synaptic resolution. Comparison of the observed connectome to
              precisely defined null models revealed unexpected network
              structure, in which a subset of food-responsive PN types converge
              on individual downstream KCs more frequently than expected. The
              connectivity bias is consistent with the neurogeometry: axons of
              the overconvergent PNs tend to arborize near one another in the
              MB main calyx, making local KC dendrites more likely to receive
              input from those types. Computational modeling of the observed
              PN-to-KC network showed that input from the overconvergent PN
              types is better discriminated than input from other types. These
              results suggest an 'associative fovea' for olfaction, in that the
              MB is wired to better discriminate more frequently occurring and

              for temperature representation in the Drosophila brain. First, we
              use a photolabelling strategy to trace the connections that relay
              peripheral thermosensory information to higher brain centres, and
              show that they largely converge onto three target regions: the
              mushroom body, the lateral horn (both of which are well known
              centres for sensory processing) and the posterior lateral
              protocerebrum, a region we now define as a major site of
              thermosensory representation. Next, using in vivo calcium

              organ (FCO)] at the femoro-tibial joint of a locust hindleg carry
              patterns of spikes to the CNS in which information is coded about
              the positions and movements of the tibia. Intracellular
              recordings from the afferents of this organ as they enter the CNS
              reveal spikes and depolarizing post-synaptic potentials (PSPs)
              during voluntary or imposed movements of the joint. Some of these
              PSPs are generated as a result of spikes in other FCO afferents,
              and can be evoked experimentally by electrical stimulation of the
              nerve from the organ. One afferent does not appear to synapse
              directly on another, but instead activates reliable pathways
              involving other central neurons. Current clamping of individual
              afferents in isolated ganglia shows that the PSPs are increased
              in amplitude by hyperpolarizing currents injected into an
              afferent, and decreased by depolarizing ones. They reverse at
              about -68 mV (n = 5). At the normal resting potential of the
              afferents, -72 mV (+/- 0.42 SE, n = 57), the PSPs are therefore
              depolarizing, and are associated with an increased conductance of
              the membrane. The changes in membrane potential and conductances
              associated with the PSPs can be mimicked by pressure injection of
              GABA into the regions of neuropil that contain the terminals of
              the afferents. The potential evoked by GABA is associated with an
              increased conductance of the membrane and reverses at the same
              potential as the PSPs. GABA also reduces the PSPs evoked in the
              terminals, either by movements of the FCO or by electrical
              stimulation of its nerve. The PSPs and the effects of the
              GABA-evoked potentials are mimicked by the GABA agonist muscimol.
              The PSPs are blocked reversibly by picrotoxin. The PSPs and the
              GABA-evoked potentials both alter the excitability of an afferent
              terminal by reducing the ability of the membrane to support an
              action potential. It is suggested that the PSPs are depolarizing,
              inhibitory potentials generated in the terminals of the afferents
              by central neurons that release GABA, and that their role is to
              change the efficacy of the afferent spikes at their first output
              synapses in the CNS. These interactions could form a graded, gain
              control mechanism for synaptic transmission at the afferent
              output synapses that is directly dependent on the features of the
              mechanical movements of the joint.",

                   at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the
                   weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free,
                   population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well
                   on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid
                   locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with
                   over four million free parameters, the largest neural
                   networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary
                   algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale
                   at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in
                   some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for
                   optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available
                   the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve
                   performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that
                   combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages
                   exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward
                   functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which
                   reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\textbackslash DQN, A3C,
                   ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster
                   than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in

              in which the animal quickly reverses and suppresses exploratory

              a diameter similar to the trap opening. There is a delay between
              the ring entry and ring closure, which allows the animal to
              withdraw from the trap before being caught. Mutants that fail to
              suppress head movements in response to touch are caught more
              efficiently than the wild-type. This demonstrates that the

              insights into the brain mechanisms underlying learning and

              conditioning, consists of learning the contingency between an
              odor with an aversive or appetitive stimulus. This conditioning
              requires the activity of molecules that can integrate the two
              types of sensory information, the odorant as the conditioned
              stimulus and the aversive or appetitive stimulus as the
              unconditioned stimulus, in brain regions where the neural
              pathways for the two stimuli intersect. Compelling data indicate
              that a particular form of adenylyl cyclase functions as a
              molecular integrator of the sensory information in the mushroom
              body neurons. The neuronal pathway carrying the olfactory
              information from the antennal lobes to the mushroom body is well

              to gate olfactory information to the mushroom bodies and thus
              control the ability to learn about odors. Emerging data obtained

              expressing the same receptors have convergent axonal projections
              to specific glomerular targets in the antennal lobe/olfactory
              bulb, creating an odour map in this first olfactory structure of
              the central nervous system. Projection neurons of the Drosophila
              antennal lobe send dendrites into glomeruli and axons to higher
              brain centres, thereby transferring this odour map further into
              the brain. Here we use the MARCM method to perform a systematic
              clonal analysis of projection neurons, allowing us to correlate
              lineage and birth time of projection neurons with their
              glomerular choice. We demonstrate that projection neurons are
              prespecified by lineage and birth order to form synapses with
              specific incoming ORN axons, and therefore to carry specific
              olfactory information. This prespecification could be used to
              hardwire the fly's olfactory system, enabling stereotyped

               To explore these issues, we used a genetic algorithm to simulate
               the evolution of a population of neural networks, each

              microscope (EM) connectome reconstruction. To this end,
              segmentation competitions, such as CREMI and SNEMI, exist to help
              researchers evaluate segmentation algorithms with the goal of
              improving them. Because generating ground truth is
              time-consuming, these competitions often fail to capture the
              challenges in segmenting larger datasets required in
              connectomics. More generally, the common metrics for EM image
              segmentation do not emphasize impact on downstream analysis and
              are often not very useful for isolating problem areas in the
              segmentation. For example, they do not capture connectivity
              information and often over-rate the quality of a segmentation as
              we demonstrate later. To address these issues, we introduce a
              novel strategy to enable evaluation of segmentation at large
              scales both in a supervised setting, where ground truth is
              available, or an unsupervised setting. To achieve this, we first
              introduce new metrics more closely aligned with the use of
              segmentation in downstream analysis and reconstruction. In
              particular, these include synapse connectivity and completeness
              metrics that provide both meaningful and intuitive
              interpretations of segmentation quality as it relates to the
              preservation of neuron connectivity. Also, we propose measures of
              segmentation correctness and completeness with respect to the
              percentage of ``orphan'' fragments and the concentrations of
              self-loops formed by segmentation failures, which are helpful in
              analysis and can be computed without ground truth. The
              introduction of new metrics intended to be used for practical
              applications involving large datasets necessitates a scalable
              software ecosystem, which is a critical contribution of this
              paper. To this end, we introduce a scalable, flexible software
              framework that enables integration of several different metrics
              and provides mechanisms to evaluate and debug differences between
              segmentations. We also introduce visualization software to help
              users to consume the various metrics collected. We evaluate our

              information into the brain, producing internal representations of
              odors detected in the periphery. A comprehensive understanding of
              the molecular and neural mechanisms of odor detection and
              processing requires complete maps of odorant receptor (Or)
              expression and ORN connectivity, preferably at single-cell
              resolution. Results: We have constructed near-complete maps of Or
              expression and ORN targeting in the Drosophila olfactory system.
              These maps confirm the general validity of the ``one neuron - one
              receptor'' and ``one glomerulus - one receptor'' principles and
              reveal several additional features of olfactory organization.
              ORNs in distinct sensilla types project to distinct regions of
              the antennal lobe, but neighbor relations are not preserved. ORNs
              grouped in the same sensilla do not express similar receptors,
              but similar receptors tend to map to closely appositioned
              glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This organization may serve to
              ensure that odor representations are dispersed in the periphery
              but clustered centrally. Integrated with electrophysiological
              data, these maps also predict glomerular representations of
              specific odorants. Representations of aliphatic and aromatic
              compounds are spatially segregated, with those of aliphatic
              compounds arranged topographically according to carbon chain

              maps provide further insight into the molecular, anatomical, and
              functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system. Our
              maps also provide an essential resource for investigating how
              internal odor representations are generated and how they are
              further processed and transmitted to higher brain centers. ??2005

              by inhibition. Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons received
              large-amplitude, fast-rising depolarizing postsynaptic
              potentials, often driving action potentials. In contrast, the
              same optogenetic stimulus evoked small-amplitude, subthreshold
              postsynaptic potentials in excitatory and non-fast-spiking (NFS)
              GABAergic neurons. To understand the synaptic mechanisms
              underlying this network activity, we investigated unitary
              synaptic connectivity through multiple simultaneous whole cell

              strong local synaptic connectivity, which might contribute to

              GABAergic synaptic inhibition is thought to play a critical role
              in olfactory processing in the antennal lobe and olfactory bulb.
              However, the properties of GABAergic neurons and the cellular
              effects of GABA have not been described in Drosophila, an
              important model organism for olfaction research. We have used
              whole-cell patch-clamp recording, pharmacology,
              immunohistochemistry, and genetic markers to investigate how
              GABAergic inhibition affects olfactory processing in the
              Drosophila antennal lobe. We show that many axonless local
              neurons (LNs) in the adult antennal lobe are GABAergic. GABA
              hyperpolarizes antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) via two
              distinct conductances, blocked by a GABAA- and GABAB-type
              antagonist, respectively. Whereas GABAA receptors shape PN odor
              responses during the early phase of odor responses, GABAB
              receptors mediate odor-evoked inhibition on longer time scales.
              The patterns of odor-evoked GABAB-mediated inhibition differ
              across glomeruli and across odors. Finally, we show that LNs
              display broad but diverse morphologies and odor preferences,
              suggesting a cellular basis for odor- and glomerulus-dependent
              patterns of inhibition. Together, these results are consistent

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

              map the developmental origin of 78 bilateral pairs of
              interneurons from seven identified neural progenitors
              (neuroblasts) within a complete TEM reconstruction of the

              developmental mechanism with neuronal projections, synapse

              neurons from project widely in the neuropil, without preferential
              circuit formation. In contrast, the two NotchON/NotchOFF
              hemilineages from each neuroblast project to either dorsal motor
              neuropil (NotchON) or ventral sensory neuropil (NotchOFF). Thus,
              each neuroblast contributes both motor and sensory processing
              neurons. Lineage-specific constitutive Notch transforms sensory
              to motor hemilineages, showing hemilineage identity determines
              neuronal targeting. Within a hemilineage, temporal cohorts target

              wiring logic of a broadly projecting serotonergic neuron (the
              ``CSDn'') that spans several olfactory regions. Within the
              antennal lobe, the CSDn differentially innervates each
              glomerulus, yet surprisingly, this variability reflects a diverse
              set of presynaptic partners, rather than glomerulus-specific
              differences in synaptic output, which is predominately to local
              interneurons. Moreover, the CSDn has distinct connectivity
              relationships with specific local interneuron subtypes,
              suggesting that the CSDn influences distinct aspects of local

              different patterns of connectivity, even having different
              connectivity with individual projection neurons that also span
              these regions. Whereas the CSDn targets inhibitory local neurons
              in the antennal lobe, the CSDn has more distributed connectivity
              in the LH, preferentially synapsing with principal neuron types

              novel synaptic partners associated with other sensory domains

              have found limited application to clinical situations where fast
              execution is required, e.g., intraoperative imaging. This paper
              presents a parallel implementation of a nonrigid image
              registration algorithm. It takes advantage of shared-memory
              multiprocessor computer architectures using multithreaded
              programming by partitioning of data and partitioning of tasks,
              depending on the computational subproblem. For three different
              biomedical applications (intraoperative brain deformation,
              contrast-enhanced MR mammography, intersubject brain
              registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm is
              quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to perform
              the computation of intra-operative brain deformation in less than
              a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU shared-memory supercomputer
              (SGI Origin 3800). It is shown that its serial component is no
              more than 2$\backslash$\% of the total computation time, allowing
              a speedup of at least a factor of 50. In most cases, the

  abstract  = "Learning is thought to be adaptive in variable environments,
               whereas constant, predictable environments are supposed to favor
               unconditional, genetically fixed responses. A dichotomous view
               of behavior as either learned or innate ignores a potential
               evolutionary interaction between the learned and innate
               components of a behavioral response. We addressed this
               interaction in the context of oviposition substrate choice in
               Drosophila melanogaster, asking two main questions. First, will
               learning also evolve in a constant environment in which it
               always pays to show the same choice? Second, how does an
               opportunity to learn affect the evolution of the innate
               (genetic) component of oviposition substrate choice? We exposed
               experimental populations to four selection regimes, involving
               selection on oviposition substrate preference (an orange versus
               a pineapple medium). In two selection regimes the flies were
               selected for preference either for the orange medium, or for the
               pineapple medium. In the remaining two selection regimes the
               flies were also selected for preference for either orange or
               pineapple, but additionally could use past experience (aversion
               learning) to decide which medium it paid to avoid. Lines exposed
               to the latter selection regimes evolved improved learning
               ability, indicating that learning may be advantageous even if
               the same behavioral response is favored every generation.
               Furthermore, of the two selection regimes that favored
               oviposition on the pineapple medium, the regime that allowed for
               learning led to the evolution of a stronger innate preference
               for pineapple, than the regime that did not allow for learning.
               In contrast, of the two regimes that selected for oviposition on
               the orange medium, the one that allowed for learning led to a
               smaller evolutionary change of the innate preference. Thus, an
               opportunity to learn facilitated the evolution of innate
               preference under selection for preference for pineapple, but
               hindered it under selection for preference for orange. We
               discuss possible mechanisms for this effect.",

               mm [1], and a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient for

  abstract = "We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor
              repertoire in the Drosophila antenna. Each receptor was expressed
              in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) used as a
              ``decoder,'' and the odor response spectrum conferred by the
              receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological
              recordings. The spectra of these receptors were then matched to
              those of defined ORNs to establish a receptor-to-neuron map. In
              addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the
              signaling mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the response
              dynamics of the neuron. An individual receptor can mediate both
              excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the
              same cell, suggesting a model of odorant receptor transduction.
              Receptors vary widely in their breadth of tuning, and odorants
              vary widely in the number of receptors they activate. Together,
              these properties provide a molecular basis for odor coding by the
              receptor repertoire of an olfactory organ.",

              suggesting that different neuroblasts produce neurons with these

              neural circuit functions. While considerable effort has been
              dedicated into simulating primate or rodent brains, the fruit fly
              (Drosophila melanogaster) is becoming a promising model animal in
              computational neuroscience for its small brain size, complex
              cognitive behavior, and abundancy of data available from genes to
              circuits. Moreover, several Drosophila connectome projects have
              generated a large number of neuronal images that account for a
              significant portion of the brain, making a systematic
              investigation of the whole brain circuit possible. Supported by
              FlyCircuit (http://www.flycircuit.tw), one of the largest
              Drosophila neuron image databases, we began a long-term project
              with the goal to construct a whole-brain spiking network model of
              the Drosophila brain. In this paper, we report the outcome of the
              first phase of the project. We developed the Flysim platform,
              which (1) identifies the polarity of each neuron arbor, (2)
              predicts connections between neurons, (3) translates morphology
              data from the database into physiology parameters for
              computational modeling, (4) reconstructs a brain-wide network
              model, which consists of 20,089 neurons and 1,044,020 synapses,
              and (5) performs computer simulations of the resting state. We
              compared the reconstructed brain network with a randomized brain
              network by shuffling the connections of each neuron. We found
              that the reconstructed brain can be easily stabilized by
              implementing synaptic short-term depression, while the randomized
              one exhibited seizure-like firing activity under the same
              treatment. Furthermore, the reconstructed Drosophila brain was
              structurally and dynamically more diverse than the randomized one
              and exhibited both Poisson-like and patterned firing activities.
              Despite being at its early stage of development, this single-cell
              level brain model allows us to study some of the fundamental

              the left hemisphere of four neurologically normal neonates (mean
              age=41+/- 40 days): primary (BA4 and BA3-1-2), unimodal (BA18),

              differences in dendritic/spine extent obtained across cortical
              regions. Most apparent were substantial differences between BA4
              and BA10: total dendritic length was 52\% greater in BA4 than
              BA10, and dendritic spine number was 67\% greater in BA4 than

  abstract = "The secondary neurons generated in the thoracic central nervous
              system of Drosophila arise from a hemisegmental set of 25
              neuronal stem cells, the neuroblasts (NBs). Each NB undergoes
              repeated asymmetric divisions to produce a series of smaller
              ganglion mother cells (GMCs), which typically divide once to form
              two daughter neurons. We find that the two daughters of the GMC
              consistently have distinct fates. Using both loss-of-function and
              gain-of-function approaches, we examined the role of Notch
              signaling in establishing neuronal fates within all of the
              thoracic secondary lineages. In all cases, the 'A' (Notch(ON))
              sibling assumes one fate and the 'B' (Notch(OFF)) sibling assumes
              another, and this relationship holds throughout the neurogenic
              period, resulting in two major neuronal classes: the A and B
              hemilineages. Apparent monotypic lineages typically result from
              the death of one sibling throughout the lineage, resulting in a
              single, surviving hemilineage. Projection neurons are
              predominantly from the B hemilineages, whereas local interneurons
              are typically from A hemilineages. Although sibling fate is
              dependent on Notch signaling, it is not necessarily dependent on
              numb, a gene classically involved in biasing Notch activation.
              When Numb was removed at the start of larval neurogenesis, both A
              and B hemilineages were still generated, but by the start of the
              third larval instar, the removal of Numb resulted in all neurons
              assuming the A fate. The need for Numb to direct Notch signaling
              correlated with a decrease in NB cell cycle time and may be a
              means for coping with multiple sibling pairs simultaneously

              experience, suggesting that the neural circuits that mediate this
              behaviour are developmentally programmed. In Drosophila,
              courtship involves a complex yet stereotyped array of dimorphic
              behaviours that are regulated by Fru(M), a male-specific isoform
              of the fruitless gene. Fru(M) is expressed in about 2,000 neurons
              in the fly brain, including three subpopulations of olfactory
              sensory neurons and projection neurons (PNs). One set of Fru(+)
              olfactory neurons expresses the odorant receptor Or67d and
              responds to the male-specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate
              (cVA). These neurons converge on the DA1 glomerulus in the
              antennal lobe. In males, activation of Or67d(+) neurons by cVA
              inhibits courtship of other males, whereas in females their
              activation promotes receptivity to other males. These
              observations pose the question of how a single pheromone acting
              through the same set of sensory neurons can elicit different
              behaviours in male and female flies. Anatomical or functional
              dimorphisms in this neural circuit might be responsible for the
              dimorphic behaviour. We therefore developed a neural tracing
              procedure that employs two-photon laser scanning microscopy to
              activate the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein. Here we
              show, using this technique, that the projections from the DA1
              glomerulus to the protocerebrum are sexually dimorphic. We
              observe a male-specific axonal arbor in the lateral horn whose
              elaboration requires the expression of the transcription factor
              Fru(M) in DA1 projection neurons and other Fru(+) cells. The
              observation that cVA activates a sexually dimorphic circuit in
              the protocerebrum suggests a mechanism by which a single
              pheromone can elicit different behaviours in males and in
              females.",

               investigated in a four-field olfactometer bioassay that is new
               for Drosophila. We determined (1) whether the sensitivity of
               this response changes with odor context, and (2) if it depends
               on sex and life stage. When CO(2) was added to ambient air in

               fields, individually observed adults avoided CO(2) (0.1-1\%

               relate this behavior to measurements of CO(2) production in
               bananas and flies. When 0.02\% CO(2) was combined with the odor
               of apple cider vinegar in one field of the olfactometer and

               that of adults. Like adults, they avoided CO(2), but with lower
               sensitivity. Larvae lacking neurons expressing Gr21a lost their
               avoidance behavior to CO(2), but kept their positive response to
               vinegar odor. Hence, Gr21a-expressing neurons mediate similar

              (dendritic region) of the mushroom bodies, a higher brain center
              essential for associative olfactory learning. The larval calyx
              has a glomerular organization. We generated a map of calyx
              glomeruli, using both anatomical criteria and the pattern of
              innervation by subsets of its input neurons (projection neurons),
              molecularly identified by GAL4 markers. Thus, we show that
              projection neurons innervate calyx glomeruli in a stereotypic
              manner. By contrast, subsets of mushroom body neurons (Kenyon
              cells) that are labeled by GAL4 markers show no clear preference
              for specific glomeruli. Clonal subsets of Kenyon cells show some
              preference for subregions of the calyx, implying that they
              receive distinct input. However, at the level of individual
              glomeruli, dendritic terminals of larval-born Kenyon cells
              innervate about six glomeruli, apparently randomly. These results
              are consistent with a model in which Kenyon cells process
              olfactory information by integrating different inputs from
              several calyx glomeruli in a combinatorial manner.",

              all invertebrates, and the brain-to-body weight ratio exceeds
              those of most fish and reptiles. The brain is composed of lobe
              units, the functions of which have been studied through surgical
              manipulation and electrical stimulation. However, how information
              is processed in each lobe for the animal to make a behavioral
              decision has rarely been investigated. To perform such functional
              analyses, it is necessary to precisely describe how brain lobes
              are spatially organized and mutually interconnected as a whole.
              We thus made three-dimensional digital brain atlases of both
              hatchling and juvenile pygmy squid, Idiosepius paradoxus. I.
              paradoxus is the smallest squid and has a brain small enough to
              scan as a whole region in the field-of-view of a
              low-magnification laser scan microscope objective. Precise
              analyses of the confocal images of the brains revealed one newly
              identified lobe and also that the relative volume of the vertical
              lobe system, the higher association center, in the pygmy squid
              represents the largest portion compared with the cephalopod
              species reported previously. In addition, principal component
              analyses of relative volumes of lobe complexes revealed that the
              organization of I. paradoxus brain is comparable to those of
              Decapodiformes species commonly used to analyze complex behaviors
              such as Sepia officinalis and Sepioteuthis sepioidea. These
              results suggest that the pygmy squid can be a good model to

              smaller subvolumes. Our results (available at

              regions with well-known anatomy, namely the antennal lobes and
              central complex, were automatically segmented into familiar
              compartments. The basis for the structural assignment is
              clustering of voxels based on patterns of enhancer expression.
              These initial clusters are agglomerated to make hierarchical
              predictions of structure. We applied the algorithm to central
              brain regions receiving input from the optic lobes. Based on the
              automated segmentation and manual validation, we can identify and

  abstract = "The antennal lobe (AL) is the primary structure in the Drosophila
              brain that relays odor information from the antennae to higher
              brain centers. The characterization of uniglomerular projection
              neurons (PNs) and some local interneurons has facilitated our
              understanding of olfaction; however, many other AL neurons remain
              unidentified. Because neuron types are mostly specified by
              lineage and temporal origins, we use the MARCM techniques with a
              set of enhancer-trap GAL4 lines to perform systematical lineage
              analysis to characterize neuron morphologies, lineage origin and
              birth timing in the three AL neuron lineages that contain
              GAL4-GH146-positive PNs: anterodorsal, lateral and ventral
              lineages. The results show that the anterodorsal lineage is
              composed of pure uniglomerular PNs that project through the inner
              antennocerebral tract. The ventral lineage produces uniglomerular
              and multiglomerular PNs that project through the middle
              antennocerebral tract. The lateral lineage generates multiple
              types of neurons, including uniglomeurlar PNs, diverse atypical
              PNs, various types of AL local interneurons and the neurons that
              make no connection within the ALs. Specific neuron types in all
              three lineages are produced in specific time windows, although
              multiple neuron types in the lateral lineage are made
              simultaneously. These systematic cell lineage analyses have not
              only filled gaps in the olfactory map, but have also exemplified

               out to ``reverse engineer'' the brain -- disassembling it to

               animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from

               the advantages of ``anticipatory regulation''; identify
               constraints on neural design and the need to ``nanofy''; and
               demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular
               system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of

               learning and memory, including the mushroom body (MB), for
               immediate sensory integration and modulation of innate behavior.
               Drosophila melanogaster must integrate contradictory sensory
               information during feeding on fermenting fruit that releases
               both food odor and the innately aversive odor CO2. Here, using

               innate avoidance mediated by CO2-responsive MB output neurons.

              proposed when the quantification of neuronal structure was
              undertaken manually, the advent of software packages allowing
              automated analysis has resulted in the introduction of several
              semi and fully automated methods to quantify dendritic
              complexity. Unfortunately results from these methods have not in
              all cases been consistent. We therefore compared the results of
              five commonly used methods (Simple Neurite Tracer, manual, Fast

              Neurite Tracer and Fast Sholl profiles have areas under the curve
              within 4.5\% of the profile derived using the manual method), we

              activity towards the earliest layers of sensory processing or to
              brain regions containing the majority of postsynaptic neurons.
              Here, we present new methods for unbiased volumetric neural
              imaging with precise across-brain registration, to characterize
              auditory activity throughout the entire central brain of
              Drosophila, and to make comparisons across trials, individuals,

              across nearly all central brain regions and in neurons known to
              carry responses to other modalities. These auditory
              representations are diverse in their temporal profiles, but the
              majority of activity, regardless of brain region, is focused on
              aspects of the conspecific courtship song. We find that auditory
              responses are stereotyped across trials and animals in early

               different cortical regions 1, 2, despite the fact that multiple
               structures of the primary olfactory cortex receive projections
               from the olfactory bulb [3]. Here, we use Drosophila as a model
               to investigate whether different olfactory information may be
               processed in separate brain structures. Organizations of the
               peripheral olfactory system are remarkably similar from mammals
               to insects [4]. As in vertebrates, the olfactory pathway in
               Drosophila follows similar convergence and divergence [5], and
               multiple high-order structures in the Drosophila brain,
               including the mushroom body (MB) and lateral horn (LH) of the
               protocerebrum, receive olfactory input 6, 7. We specifically
               blocked neurotransmission in the MB while leaving the LH
               unaffected and examined its effect on olfactory avoidance and
               attraction behaviors. We show that blocking MB activity
               disrupted responses to attractive, but not repulsive, odors, and
               this finding suggests that attractive and repulsive olfactory
               information may be separately processed in higher olfactory

  abstract = "The ability to modify behavior based on prior experience is
              essential to an animal's survival. For example, animals may
              become attracted to a previously neutral odor or reject a
              previously appetitive food source upon learning. In Drosophila,
              the mushroom bodies (MBs) are critical for olfactory associative
              learning and conditioned taste aversion, but how the output of
              the MBs affects specific behavioral responses is unresolved. In
              conditioned taste aversion, Drosophila shows a specific
              behavioral change upon learning: proboscis extension to sugar is
              reduced after a sugar stimulus is paired with an aversive
              stimulus. While studies have identified MB output neurons (MBONs)
              that drive approach or avoidance behavior, whether the same MBONs
              impact proboscis extension behavior is unknown. Here, we tested
              the role of MB pathways in modulating proboscis extension and
              identified 10 MBON split-GAL4 lines that upon activation
              significantly decreased proboscis extension to sugar. Activating
              several of these lines also decreased sugar consumption,
              revealing that these MBONs have a general role in modifying
              feeding behavior beyond proboscis extension. Although the MBONs
              that decreased proboscis extension and ingestion are different
              from those that drive avoidance behavior in another context, the
              diversity of their arborizations demonstrates that a distributed
              network influences proboscis extension behavior. These studies

              taste compounds and modifies feeding decisions.",

               to an aversive odour: individual flies weakly avoid the
               stimulus, but groups show enhanced escape reactions. Using

  abstract = "In Drosophila most thoracic neuroblasts have two neurogenic
              periods: an initial brief period during embryogenesis and a
              second prolonged phase during larval growth. This study focuses
              on the adult-specific neurons that are born primarily during the
              second phase of neurogenesis. The fasciculated neurites arising
              from each cluster of adult-specific neurons express the
              cell-adhesion protein Neurotactin and they make a complex
              scaffold of neurite bundles within the thoracic neuropils. Using
              MARCM clones, we identified the 24 lineages that make up the
              scaffold of a thoracic hemineuromere. Unlike the early-born
              neurons that are strikingly diverse in both form and function,
              the adult specific cells in a given lineage are remarkably
              similar and typically project to only one or two initial targets,
              which appear to be the bundled neurites from other lineages.
              Correlated changes in the contacts between the lineages in
              different segments suggest that these initial contacts have
              functional significance in terms of future synaptic partners.

  abstract  = "Behavioural responses of animals to volatiles in their
               environment are generally dependent on context. Most natural
               odours are mixtures of components that can each induce different
               behaviours when presented on their own. We have investigated how
               a complex of two olfactory stimuli is evaluated by Drosophila
               flies in a free-flying two-trap choice assay and how these
               stimuli are encoded in olfactory receptor neurons. We first
               observed that volatiles from apple cider vinegar attracted flies
               while carbon dioxide (CO2) was avoided, confirming their
               inherent positive and negative values. In contradiction with
               previous results obtained from walking flies in a four-field
               olfactometer, in the present assay the addition of CO2 to
               vinegar increased rather than decreased the attractiveness of
               vinegar. This effect was female-specific even though males and
               females responded similarly to CO2 and vinegar on their own. To
               test whether the female-specific behavioural response to the
               mixture correlated with a sexual dimorphism at the peripheral
               level we recorded from olfactory receptor neurons stimulated
               with vinegar, CO2 and their combination. Responses to vinegar
               were obtained from three neuron classes, two of them housed with
               the CO2-responsive neuron in ab1 sensilla. Sensitivity of these
               neurons to both CO2 and vinegar per se did not differ between
               males and females and responses from female neurons did not
               change when CO2 and vinegar were presented simultaneously. We
               also found that CO2-sensitive neurons are particularly well
               adapted to respond rapidly to small concentration changes
               irrespective of background CO2 levels. The ability to encode
               temporal properties of stimulations differs considerably between
               CO2- and vinegar-sensitive neurons. These properties may have
               important implications for in-flight navigation when rapid
               responses to fragmented odour plumes are crucial to locate odour
               sources. However, the flies' sex-specific response to the
               CO2-vinegar combination and the context-dependent hedonics most
               likely originate from central rather than peripheral processing.",

  abstract  = "The notion of the command cell has been highly influential in
               invertebrate neurobiology, and related notions have been
               increasingly used in research on the vertebrate nervous system.
               The term ``command neuron'' implies that the neuron has some
               critical function in the generation of a normally occurring
               behavior. Nevertheless, most authors either explicitly or
               implicitly use a strictly operational definition, independent of
               considerations of normal behavioral function. That is, command
               neurons are often defined as neurons which, when stimulated by
               the experimenter, evoke some behavioral response. Even when
               utilizing such an operational definition, investigators
               frequently differ on what they consider to be the exact
               characteristics that a neuron must have (or not have) to be
               considered a command cell. A few authors appear to treat command
               neurons in relation to normal function, but a precise
               behaviorally relevant definition has not been specified. Because
               of the ambiguity in the definition of command neurons, the term
               can refer to a wide variety of neurons which may play divergent
               behavioral roles. In some ways the attempt to label a cell as a
               command neuron may interfere with the process of discovering the
               complex causal determinants of behavior. Nevertheless, the
               notion that individual cells are responsible for certain
               behaviors is highly appealing, and an attempt to define the
               command neuron rigorously could be worthwhile. We suggest that a
               command neuron be defined as a neuron that is both necessary and
               sufficient for the initiation of a given behavior. These
               criteria can by tested by: (1) establishing the response pattern
               of the putative command neuron during presentation of a given
               stimulus and execution of a well specified behavior; (2)
               removing the neuron and showing that the response is no longer
               elicited by the stimulus (necessary condition); and (3) firing
               the neuron in its normal pattern and showing that the complete
               behavioral response occurs (sufficient condition). In some
               cases, groups of neurons, when treated as a whole, may satisfy
               the necessity and sufficiency criteria for a given behavior,
               even though individual neurons of the group fail to meet the
               criteria. We suggest that such a group be termed a ``command
               system'' for the behavior in question. Individual neurons in the
               command system can be termed ``command elements'' if, when fired
               in their normally occurring pattern, they elicit a part of the
               behavior, or ``modulatory elements'' if they do not in isolation
               elicit any response, but alter the behavior produced by other
               elements in the command system.",

              of a panorama. How downstream neurons integrate these features to
              control vital behaviors, like escape, is unclear [15]. In
              Drosophila, the timing of a single spike in the giant fiber (GF)
              descending neuron [16-18] determines whether a fly uses a short
              or long takeoff when escaping a looming predator [13]. We
              previously proposed that GF spike timing results from summation
              of two visual features whose detection is highly conserved across
              animals [19]: an object's subtended angular size and its angular
              velocity [5-8, 11, 20, 21]. We attributed velocity encoding to
              input from lobula columnar type 4 (LC4) visual projection
              neurons, but the size-encoding source remained unknown. Here, we
              show that lobula plate/lobula columnar, type 2 (LPLC2) visual
              projection neurons anatomically specialized to detect looming
              [22] provide the entire GF size component. We find LPLC2 neurons
              to be necessary for GF-mediated escape and show that LPLC2 and
              LC4 synapse directly onto the GF via reconstruction in a fly
              brain electron microscopy (EM) volume [23]. LPLC2 silencing
              eliminates the size component of the GF looming response in
              patch-clamp recordings, leaving only the velocity component. A
              model summing a linear function of angular velocity (provided by
              LC4) and a Gaussian function of angular size (provided by LPLC2)
              replicates GF looming response dynamics and predicts the peak
              response time. We thus present an identified circuit in which

  abstract = "Behavior is a manifestation of temporally and spatially defined
              neuronal activities. To understand how behavior is controlled by
              the nervous system, it is important to identify the neuronal
              substrates responsible for these activities, and to elucidate how
              they are integrated into a functional circuit. I introduce a
              novel and general method to conditionally perturb anatomically
              defined neurons in intact Drosophila. In this method, a
              temperature-sensitive allele of shibire (shi(ts1)) is
              overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the GAL4/UAS system.
              Because the shi gene product is essential for synaptic vesicle
              recycling, and shi(ts1) is semidominant, a simple temperature
              shift should lead to fast and reversible effects on synaptic
              transmission of shi(ts1) expressing neurons. When shi(ts1)
              expression was directed to cholinergic neurons, adult flies
              showed a dramatic response to the restrictive temperature,
              becoming motionless within 2 min at 30 degrees C. This
              temperature-induced paralysis was reversible. After being shifted
              back to the permissive temperature, they readily regained their
              activity and started to walk in 1 min. When shi(ts1) was
              expressed in photoreceptor cells, adults and larvae exhibited
              temperature-dependent blindness. These observations show that the
              GAL4/UAS system can be used to express shi(ts1) in a specific
              subset of neurons to cause temperature-dependent changes in
              behavior. Because this method allows perturbation of the neuronal
              activities rapidly and reversibly in a spatially and temporally
              restricted manner, it will be useful to study the functional
              significance of particular neuronal subsets in the behavior of
              intact animals.",

              trajectories after encountering and losing a plume of an
              attractive odorant. We have characterized the three-dimensional
              flight behavior of D. melanogaster in a wind tunnel under a

              hungry flies initiate flight and display anemotactic orientation.
              Following contact with a narrow ribbon plume of an attractive
              odor, flies reduce their crosswind velocity while flying faster
              upwind, resulting in a surge directed toward the odor source.
              Following loss of odor contact due to plume truncation, flies
              frequently initiate a stereotyped crosswind casting response, a
              behavior rarely observed in a continuous odor plume. Similarly,
              within a homogeneous odor cloud, flies move fast while

              coordinate their reorganization, are poorly understood. In
              Drosophila, olfactory projection neurons (PNs) receive input by
              synapsing with olfactory receptor neurons in the antennal lobe
              and relay information to the mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral
              horn. Here we show that embryonic-born PNs participate in both
              the larval and adult olfactory circuits. In the larva, these
              neurons generally innervate a single glomerulus in the antennal
              lobe and one or two glomerulus-like substructures in the MB
              calyx. They persist in the adult olfactory circuit and are

              Electron microscopy analysis reveals that these PNs synapse with

               The behavioral response showed specific adaptation to the

              ``atypical'' spiny neurons in terms of morphology and/or

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Morphological features are widely used in the study
              of neuronal function and pathology. Invertebrate neurons are
              often structurally stereotypical, showing little variance in
              gross spatial features but larger variance in their fine
              features. Such variability can be quantified using detailed
              spatial analysis, which however requires the morphologies to be
              registered to a common frame of reference. RESULTS: We outline
              here new algorithms - Reg-MaxS and Reg-MaxS-N - for
              co-registering pairs and groups of morphologies, respectively.
              Reg-MaxS applies a sequence of translation, rotation and scaling
              transformations, estimating at each step the transformation
              parameters that maximize spatial overlap between the volumes
              occupied by the morphologies. We test this algorithm with
              synthetic morphologies, showing that it can account for a wide
              range of transformation differences and is robust to noise.
              Reg-MaxS-N co-registers groups of more than two morphologies by
              iteratively calculating an average volume and registering all
              morphologies to this average using Reg-MaxS. We test Reg-MaxS-N
              using five groups of morphologies from the Droshophila
              melanogaster brain and identify the cases for which it
              outperforms existing algorithms and produce morphologies very
              similar to those obtained from registration to a standard brain
              atlas. CONCLUSIONS: We have described and tested algorithms for
              co-registering pairs and groups of neuron morphologies. We have
              demonstrated their application to spatial comparison of
              stereotypic morphologies and calculation of dendritic density
              profiles, showing how our algorithms for registering neuron
              morphologies can enable new approaches in comparative
              morphological analyses and visualization.",

              a matter of continuing debate. For example, do cortical

              Recently, several groups have used microarrays to measure

  abstract = "Investigating how information propagates between layers in the
              olfactory system is an important step toward understanding the
              olfactory code. Each glomerular output projection neuron (PN)
              receives two sources of input: the olfactory receptor neurons
              (ORNs) of the same glomerulus and interneurons that innervate
              many glomeruli. We therefore asked how these inputs interact to
              produce PN output. We used receptor gene mutations to silence all
              of the ORNs innervating a specific glomerulus and recorded PN
              activity with two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology.
              We found evidence for balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
              inputs but saw little or no response in the absence of direct ORN
              input. We next asked whether any transformation of activity
              occurs at successive layers of the antennal lobe. We found a
              strong link between PN firing and dendritic calcium elevation,
              the latter of which is tightly correlated with calcium activity
              in ORN axons, supporting the idea of glomerular propagation of
              olfactory information. Finally, we showed that odors are
              represented by a sparse population of PNs. Together, these
              results are consistent with the idea that direct receptor input
              provides the main excitatory drive to PNs, whereas interneurons
              modulate PN output. Balanced excitatory and inhibitory

              to extract biologically relevant stimuli. Many male-female or
              insect-plant interactions depend on this phenomenon. Especially
              communication among individuals within social groups depends on
              innate behaviors. One example is the efficient recruitment of
              nest mates by successful bumblebee foragers. Returning foragers
              release a recruitment pheromone in the nest while they perform a
              'dance' behavior to activate unemployed nest mates. A major
              component of this pheromone is the sesquiterpenoid farnesol. How
              farnesol is processed and perceived by the olfactory system, has
              not yet been identified. It is much likely that processing
              farnesol involves an innate mechanism for the extraction of
              relevant information to trigger a fast and reliable behavioral
              response. To test this hypothesis, we used population response
              analyses of 100 antennal lobe (AL) neurons recorded in alive
              bumblebee workers under repeated stimulation with four
              behaviorally different, but chemically related odorants
              (geraniol, citronellol, citronellal and farnesol). The analysis
              identified a unique neural representation of the recruitment
              pheromone component compared to the other odorants that are
              predominantly emitted by flowers. The farnesol induced population
              activity in the AL allowed a reliable separation of farnesol from
              all other chemically related odor stimuli we tested. We conclude
              that the farnesol induced population activity may reflect a
              predetermined representation within the AL-neural network
              allowing efficient and fast extraction of a behaviorally relevant
              stimulus. Furthermore, the results show that population response
              analyses of multiple single AL-units may provide a powerful tool

              projections into specific neuropils, we unravel the regional
              development of the brain neural network. Exhaustive clonal

              Bioscience, Inc. (Williston, VT) developed the integrative

              previously shown that second order projection neurons (PNs) in

              the contribution of each activated glomerulus. Apple cider
              vinegar triggers robust innate attraction at a relatively low
              concentration, which activates six glomeruli. By silencing
              individual glomeruli, here we show that the absence of activity

              well as an unexpected large population of 61 feedback neuron
              pairs that provide one- and two-step feedback from MB output
              neurons. The majority of these feedback pathways link distinct
              memory systems (e.g. aversive and appetitive). We functionally
              confirmed some of the structural pathways and found that some
              modulatory neurons compare inhibitory input from their own

               Drosophila species that, in turn, may vector their dispersal in
               natural environments. Differential attractiveness experiments
               and the isolation of yeasts consumed by Drosophila may be
               informative for characterizing this association. Hanseniaspora
               uvarum is among the most common yeast species isolated from
               Drosophila crops, with high attractiveness to drosophilids.
               Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used to collect flies,
               and it allows broad sampling of almost all local Drosophila
               species. Pronounced differences in the field concerning
               Drosophila attractivity to baits seeded with these yeast species
               have been previously reported. However, few explicit
               generalizations have been set. Since late fifties, no field
               experiments of Drosophila attractivity were carried out in the
               Neotropical region, which is facing shifts in abiotic and biotic
               factors. Our objective is to characterize preference behavior
               that mediates the interaction in the wild among Neotropical
               Drosophila species and yeasts associated with them. We want to
               set a broad generalization about drosophilids attracted to these
               yeasts. Here we present the results of a differential
               attractiveness experiment we carried out in a natural Atlantic
               Rainforest fragment to assess the preferences of Drosophila
               species groups to baits inoculated with H. uvarum and S.
               cerevisiae. METHODS: Both yeast species were cultured in GYMP
               broth and separately poured in autoclaved mashed banana that was
               left fermenting. In the field, we collected drosophilids over
               five arrays of three different baits: non-inoculated autoclaved
               banana and banana inoculated with each yeast. In the laboratory
               the drosophilids were sorted to five sets according to their
               external morphology and/or genitalia: tripunctata; guarani;
               willistoni; exotic; and the remaining flies pooled in others.
               RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Uninoculated banana baits attracted
               virtually no flies. We found significant departures from random
               distribution over the other two baits (1:1 proportion) for all
               sets, except the pooled others. Flies of the sets willistoni and
               exotic preferred H. uvarum over S. cerevisiae, while the
               remaining sets were more attracted to S. cerevisiae. Previously,
               various authors reported similar patterns in attraction
               experiments with S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum. It is also
               noteworthy that both yeast species have been isolated from
               natural substrates and crops of Drosophila species. Taken
               together, these results suggest that the preferences among
               Drosophila species groups may be reflecting deep and stable
               relations with yeast species in natural environments. They can
               be summarized as: forest dwelling species from subgenus
               Drosophila (such as tripunctata and guarani groups) are
               attracted to banana baits seeded with S. cerevisiae; while
               exotic (as D. melanogaster) and subgenus Sophophora species are
               preferentially attracted to baits seeded with H. uvarum.",

              (neuroblast) and forms a genetic and structural unit of the
              brain. The task of reconstructing brain circuitry at the level of
              individual neurons can be made significantly easier by assigning
              neurons to their respective lineages. In this article we address
              the automation of neuron and lineage identification. We focused
              on the Drosophila brain lineages at the larval stage when they
              form easily recognizable secondary axon tracts (SATs) that were
              previously partially characterized. We now generated an annotated
              digital database containing all lineage tracts reconstructed from
              five registered wild-type brains, at higher resolution and
              including some that were previously not characterized. We
              developed a method for SAT structural comparisons based on a
              dynamic programming approach akin to nucleotide sequence
              alignment and a machine learning classifier trained on the

              aligned wild-type SATs. Next, we used our method for the
              identification of SATs within wild-type larval brains, and found
              it highly accurate (93-99\%). The method proved highly robust for

              lateral inhibition in the periphery can modulate olfactory

              The neuroarchitecture of the largest of these modules, the
              fan-shaped body, is characterized by its stereotypic set of
              decussating fiber bundles. These are generated during development
              by axons from four homologous protocerebral lineages which enter
              the commissural system and subsequently decussate at stereotypic
              locations across the brain midline. Since the commissural
              organization prior to fan-shaped body formation has not been
              previously analyzed in either species, it was not clear how the
              decussating bundles relate to individual lineages, or if the

              the commencement of axon decussation in both species reveals that

              the most miniaturized of animal brains. The reconstructions allow
              us, for the first time to our knowledge, to study variations
              between circuits in the medulla's neighboring columns. This
              variation in the number of synapses and the types of their
              synaptic partners has previously been little addressed because
              methods that visualize multiple circuits have not resolved
              detailed connections, and existing connectomic studies, which can
              see such connections, have not so far examined multiple
              reconstructions of the same circuit. Here, we address the
              omission by comparing the circuits common to all seven columns to
              assess variation in their connection strengths and the resultant
              rates of several different and distinct types of connection

              part of a consensus circuit, and we classify those contacts that

              the same cell is both presynaptic and postsynaptic at the same
              synapse, are occasionally seen; two cells in particular, Dm9 and

              These results delimit the accuracy of developmental events that

              precision, and thereby address the operation of such circuits.

              and transverse motion over a planar substrate, and use it to
              develop a simple, reflexive neuromuscular model from physical
              principles. The mechanical model represents the midline of the
              larva as a set of point masses which interact with each other via
              damped translational and torsional springs, and with the
              environment via sliding friction forces. The neuromuscular model
              consists of: 1. segmentally localised reflexes that amplify axial
              compression in order to counteract frictive energy losses, and 2.
              long-range mutual inhibition between reflexes in distant
              segments, enabling overall motion of the model larva relative to
              its substrate. In the absence of damping and driving, the
              mechanical model produces axial travelling waves, lateral
              oscillations, and unpredictable, chaotic deformations. The
              neuromuscular model counteracts friction to recover these motion

              important roles in insect mating systems. In the model Drosophila
              melanogaster, a key part of the pheromone-detecting system has
              remained enigmatic through many years of research in terms of
              both its behavioral significance and its activating ligands. Here
              we show that Or47b-and Or88a-expressing olfactory sensory neurons
              (OSNs) detect the fly-produced odorants methyl laurate (ML),
              methyl myristate, and methyl palmitate. Fruitless
              (fru(M))-positive Or47b-expressing OSNs detect ML exclusively,
              and Or47b- and Or47b-expressing OSNs are required for optimal
              male copulation behavior. In addition, activation of
              Or47b-expressing OSNs in the male is sufficient to provide a
              competitive mating advantage. We further find that the vigorous
              male courtship displayed toward oenocyte-less flies is attributed
              to an oenocyte-independent sustained production of the Or47b
              ligand, ML. In addition, we reveal that Or88a-expressing OSNs
              respond to all three compounds, and that these neurons are
              necessary and sufficient for attraction behavior in both males
              and females. Beyond the OSN level, information regarding the
              three fly odorants is transferred from the antennal lobe to
              higher brain centers in two dedicated neural lines. Finally, we
              find that both Or47b- and Or88a-based systems and their ligands
              are remarkably conserved over a number of drosophilid species.
              Taken together, our results close a significant gap in the
              understanding of the olfactory background to Drosophila mating
              and attraction behavior; while reproductive isolation barriers
              between species are created mainly by species-specific signals,
              the mating enhancing signal in several Drosophila species is
              conserved.",

               extend their axons and dendrites into all layers. They are also
               unusual in having both an axonal and a dendritic zone for the
               initiation of action potentials. Distal dendritic inputs, which
               normally appear greatly attenuated at the axon, must cross a
               high threshold at the dendritic initiation zone to evoke calcium
               action potentials but can then generate bursts of axonal action
               potentials. Here we show that a single back-propagating sodium
               action potential generated in the axon facilitates the
               initiation of these calcium action potentials when it coincides
               with distal dendritic input within a time window of several
               milliseconds. Inhibitory dendritic input can selectively block
               the initiation of dendritic calcium action potentials,
               preventing bursts of axonal action potentials. Thus, excitatory
               and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arising in the distal
               dendrites can exert significantly greater control over action
               potential initiation in the axon than would be expected from
               their electrotonically isolated locations. The coincidence of a
               single back-propagating action potential with a subthreshold
               distal excitatory postsynaptic potential to evoke a burst of
               axonal action potentials represents a new mechanism by which the

  author    = "Huang, Gary B and Scheffer, Louis K and Plaza, Stephen M",
  abstract  = "Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data
               set requires identification of neurons and determination of
               connections (synapses) between neurons. As manual extraction of
               this information is very time-consuming, there has been
               extensive research efforts to automatically segment the neurons
               to help guide and eventually replace manual tracing. Until
               recently, there has been comparatively little research on
               automatic detection of the actual synapses between neurons. This
               discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several factors:
               obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite for the first step
               in extracting a connectome, manual tracing is much more
               time-consuming than annotating synapses, and neuronal contact
               area can be used as a proxy for synapses in determining
               connections. However, recent research has demonstrated that
               contact area alone is not a sufficient predictor of a synaptic
               connection. Moreover, as segmentation improved, we observed that
               synapse annotation consumes a more significant fraction of
               overall reconstruction time (upwards of 50\% of total effort).
               This ratio will only get worse as segmentation improves, gating
               the overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we address this
               problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect
               presynaptic neurons and their postsynaptic partners. In
               particular, presynaptic structures are detected using a U-Net
               convolutional neural network (CNN), and postsynaptic partners
               are detected using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with features
               conditioned on the local segmentation. This work is novel
               because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages
               advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete
               solution for polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce
               novel metrics to evaluate our algorithm on connectomes of
               meaningful size. When applied to the output of our method on EM
               data from Drosphila, these metrics demonstrate that a completely
               automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize
               most of the connectivity correctly.",

  abstract = "It has been known for more than 40 years that individual neurons
              can produce more than one neurotransmitter and that neuropeptides
              often are colocalized with small molecule neurotransmitters
              (SMNs). Over the years much progress has been made in
              understanding the functional consequences of cotransmission in
              the nervous system of mammals. There are also some excellent
              invertebrate models that have revealed roles of coexpressed
              neuropeptides and SMNs in increasing complexity, flexibility, and
              dynamics in neuronal signaling. However, for the fly Drosophila
              there are surprisingly few functional studies on cotransmission,
              although there is ample evidence for colocalization of
              neuroactive compounds in neurons of the CNS, based both on
              traditional techniques and novel single cell transcriptome
              analysis. With the hope to trigger interest in initiating
              cotransmission studies, this review summarizes what is known
              about Drosophila neurons and neuronal circuits where different
              neuropeptides and SMNs are colocalized. Coexistence of
              neuroactive substances has been recorded in different neuron
              types such as neuroendocrine cells, interneurons, sensory cells
              and motor neurons. Some of the circuits highlighted here are well
              established in the analysis of learning and memory, circadian
              clock networks regulating rhythmic activity and sleep, as well as
              neurons and neuroendocrine cells regulating olfaction,
              nociception, feeding, metabolic homeostasis, diuretic functions,
              reproduction, and developmental processes. One emerging trait is
              the broad role of short neuropeptide F in cotransmission and
              presynaptic facilitation in a number of different neuronal
              circuits. This review also discusses the functional relevance of
              coexisting peptides in the intestine. Based on recent single cell
              transcriptomics data, it is likely that the neuronal systems
              discussed in this review are just a fraction of the total set of
              circuits where cotransmission occurs in Drosophila. Thus, a
              systematic search for colocalized neuroactive compounds in
              further neurons in anatomically defined circuits is of interest
              for the near future.",

               divides asymmetrically to produce a chain of ganglion mother

              larval and adult movement that cannot be explained by the simple
              loss in odorant detection. In addition to olfactory sensory
              neurons, Acj6 is expressed in a distinct subset of postmitotic
              interneurons in the central nervous system from late embryonic to
              adult stages. In the larval and adult brain, Acj6 is highly
              expressed in central brain, optic and antennal lobe neurons. Loss

              disorganized retinal axon targeting and synapse selection.
              Furthermore, the lamina neurons themselves exhibit disorganized

              signal flow can be obtained by experimentally identifying
              neuronal polarity (axons or dendrites). However, the experimental
              techniques are not applicable to existing neuronal databases in
              which polarity information is not available. To address the
              issue, we proposed SPIN: a method of Skeleton-based Polarity
              Identification for Neurons. SPIN was designed to work with
              large-scale neuronal databases in which tracing-line data are
              available. In SPIN, a classifier is first trained by neurons with
              known polarity in two steps: 1) identifying morphological
              features that most correlate with the polarity and 2)
              constructing a linear classifier by determining a discriminant
              axis (a specific combination of the features) and decision
              boundaries. Each polarity-undefined neuron is then divided into
              several morphological substructures (domains) and the
              corresponding polarities are determined using the classifier.
              Finally, the result is evaluated and warnings for potential
              errors are returned. We tested this method on fruitfly
              (Drosophila melanogaster) and blowfly (Calliphora vicina and
              Calliphora erythrocephala) unipolar neurons using data obtained
              from the Flycircuit and Neuromorpho databases, respectively. On
              average, the polarity of 84-92 \% of the terminal points in each
              neuron could be correctly identified. An ideal performance with
              an accuracy between 93 and 98 \% can be achieved if we fed SPIN
              with relatively ``clean'' data without artificial branches. Our
              result demonstrates that SPIN, as a computer-based semi-automatic
              method, provides quick and accurate polarity identification and
              is particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale data. We

              Functional circuits in the brain require precise neuronal wiring
              and tight control of neuronal numbers. How this accurate control
              of neuronal numbers is achieved during neural development is
              largely unclear. Specifically, the role of programmed cell death
              in control of cell numbers has not been studied in the central
              brain neuroblast lineages. Here, we focus on four postembryonic
              neuroblast lineages in the central brain identified on the basis
              that they express the homeobox gene engrailed (en). For each
              lineage, we determine the total number of adult-specific neurons
              generated as well as number and pattern of en-expressing cells.
              We then demonstrate that programmed cell death has a pronounced
              effect on the number of cells in the four lineages; approximately
              half of the immature adult-specific neurons in three of the four
              lineages are eliminated by cell death during postembryonic
              development. Moreover, we show that programmed cell death
              selectively affects en-positive versus en-negative cells in a
              lineage-specific manner and, thus, controls the relative number
              of en-expressing neurons in each lineage. Furthermore, we provide
              evidence that Notch signaling is involved in the regulation of en

              these types, the coeloconic sensilla, have been essentially
              unexplored. We define four functional types of coeloconic
              sensilla through extracellular physiological recordings. Each

              seven distinct ORN classes that vary remarkably in their breadth
              of tuning. Analysis of 315 odorant--ORN combinations reveals how
              these neurons sample odor space via both excitation and
              inhibition. We identify a class of neurons that is narrowly tuned

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Behavioral responses to odorants require neurons of
              the higher olfactory centers to integrate signals detected by
              different chemosensory neurons. Recent studies revealed
              stereotypic arborizations of second-order olfactory neurons from
              the primary olfactory center to the secondary centers, but how
              third-order neurons read this odor map remained unknown. RESULTS:
              Using the Drosophila brain as a model system, we analyzed the
              connectivity patterns between second-order and third-order
              olfactory neurons. We first isolated three common projection
              zones in the two secondary centers, the mushroom body (MB) and
              the lateral horn (LH). Each zone receives converged information
              via second-order neurons from particular subgroups of
              antennal-lobe glomeruli. In the MB, third-order neurons extend
              their dendrites across various combinations of these zones, and
              axons of this heterogeneous population of neurons converge in the
              output region of the MB. In contrast, arborizations of the
              third-order neurons in the LH are constrained within a zone.
              Moreover, different zones of the LH are linked with different
              brain areas and form preferential associations between distinct
              subsets of antennal-lobe glomeruli and higher brain regions.
              CONCLUSIONS: MB is known to be an indispensable site for
              olfactory learning and memory, whereas LH function is reported to
              be sufficient for mediating direct nonassociative responses to
              odors. The structural organization of second-order and
              third-order neurons suggests that MB is capable of integrating a
              wide range of odorant information across glomeruli, whereas
              relatively little integration between different subsets of the
              olfactory signal repertoire is likely to occur in the LH.",

              generate the primary neurons that constitute the larval brain.
              Neuroblasts reactivate in the larva, adding to their lineages a
              large number of secondary neurons which, according to previous
              studies in which selected lineages were labeled by stably

              neurons forming a given lineage the ``projection envelope'' of
              that lineage. By inducing MARCM clones at the early larval stage,
              we labeled the secondary progeny of each neuroblast. For the

              Most lineages have a number of important characteristics in
              common. Typically, neurons of a lineage stay together as a
              coherent cluster and project their axons into a coherent bundle
              visible from late embryo to adult. Neurons born during the
              embryonic period form the primary axon tracts (PATs) that follow
              stereotyped pathways in the neuropile. Apoptotic cell death
              removes an average of 30-40\% of primary neurons around the time
              of hatching. Secondary neurons generated during the larval period
              form secondary axon tracts (SATs) that typically fasciculate with
              their corresponding primary axon tract. SATs develop into the
              long fascicles that interconnect the different compartments of
              the adult brain. Structurally, we distinguish between three types
              of lineages: PD lineages, characterized by distinct, spatially
              separate proximal and distal arborizations; C lineages with
              arborizations distributed continuously along the entire length of
              their tract; D lineages that lack proximal arborizations.
              Arborizations of many lineages, in particular those of the PD
              type, are restricted to distinct neuropile compartments. We
              propose that compartments are ``scaffolded'' by individual
              lineages, or small groups thereof. Thereby, the relatively small
              number of primary neurons of each primary lineage set up the
              compartment map in the late embryo. Compartments grow during the
              larval period simply by an increase in arbor volume of primary
              neurons. Arbors of secondary neurons form within or adjacent to
              the larval compartments, resulting in smaller compartment

              to chemical cues in the environment, is important for the
              survival of most organisms. The vinegar fly, Drosophila
              melanogaster, displays robust olfactory aversion and attraction,
              but how these behaviors are executed via changes in locomotion
              remains poorly understood. In particular, it is not clear whether
              aversion and attraction bidirectionally modulate a shared circuit
              or recruit distinct circuits for execution. RESULTS: Using a
              quantitative behavioral assay, we determined that both aversive
              and attractive odorants modulate the initiation and direction of
              turns but display distinct kinematics. Using genetic tools to
              perturb these behaviors, we identified specific populations of
              neurons required for aversion, but not for attraction.
              Inactivation of these populations of cells affected the
              completion of aversive turns, but not their initiation.
              Optogenetic activation of the same populations of cells triggered
              a locomotion pattern resembling aversive turns. Perturbations in
              both the ellipsoid body and the ventral nerve cord, two regions
              involved in motor control, resulted in defects in aversion.
              CONCLUSIONS: Aversive chemotaxis in vinegar flies triggers
              ethologically appropriate kinematics distinct from those of
              attractive chemotaxis and requires specific motor-related

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The number of neurons generated by neural stem cells
              is dependent upon the regulation of cell proliferation and by
              programmed cell death. Recently, novel neural stem cells that
              amplify neural proliferation through intermediate neural
              progenitors, called type II neuroblasts, have been discovered,
              which are active during brain development in Drosophila. We
              investigated programmed cell death in the dorsomedial (DM)
              amplifying type II lineages that contribute neurons to the
              development of the central complex in Drosophila, using clonal
              mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) and
              lineage-tracing techniques. RESULTS: A significant number of the
              adult-specific neurons generated in these DM lineages were
              eliminated by programmed cell death. Programmed cell death
              occurred during both larval and pupal stages. During larval
              development, approximately one-quarter of the neuronal (but not
              glial) cells in the lineages were eliminated by apoptosis before
              the formation of synaptic connectivity during pupal stages.
              Lineage-tracing experiments documented the extensive contribution
              of intermediate neural progenitor-containing DM lineages to all
              of the major modular substructures of the adult central complex.
              Moreover, blockage of apoptotic cell death specifically in these
              lineages led to prominent innervation defects of DM-derived
              neural progeny in the major neuropile substructures of the adult
              central complex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that
              significant neural overproliferation occurs normally in type II
              DM lineage development, and that elimination of excess neurons in
              these lineages through programmed cell death is required for the
              formation of correct neuropile innervation in the developing
              central complex. Thus, amplification of neuronal proliferation
              through intermediate progenitors and reduction of neuronal number
              through programmed cell death operate in concert in type II
              neural stem-cell lineages during brain development.",

              given muscle fire in a specific order that is determined by a
              gradient of cellular size and electrical excitability. This
              hierarchy allows premotor circuits to recruit motor neurons of
              increasing force capacity in a task-dependent manner. However, it

              species with more compact motor systems, such as the fruit fly,
              Drosophila melanogaster, which has just 52 motor neurons per leg.
              Using in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we found

              excitatory local neurons (eLNs) and projection neurons (PNs)
              showed that eLN-to-PN synapses transmit both hyperpolarization

              This mutation eliminates odor-evoked lateral excitation in PNs

              excitation is mediated by electrical synapses from eLNs onto PNs.
              In addition, eLNs form synapses onto inhibitory LNs. Eliminating

              courtship and mating behaviours by the receiver. Male Drosophila
              melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped reproductive
              behaviours towards females, and these behaviours are controlled

              important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship
              function of Ionotropic receptor 84a (IR84a), which is a member of
              the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family, in a
              previously uncharacterized population of FRU(M)-positive OSNs.
              IR84a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived
              chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and
              phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other
              plant tissues that serve as food sources and oviposition sites
              for drosophilid flies. Mutation of Ir84a abolishes both
              odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in
              these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour.
              Conversely, male courtship is increased--in an IR84a-dependent
              manner--in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the
              presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR84a.
              Interneurons downstream of IR84a-expressing OSNs innervate a
              pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR84a
              orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present
              in diverse drosophilid species, IR84a is absent from insects that

              which IR84a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M)
              courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an

              in the Drosophila antennal lobe, the first relay in the olfactory
              system and a model circuit for understanding olfactory
              processing. In the antennal lobe, one-third of local neurons are
              glutamatergic. Using in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings,
              we found that many glutamatergic local neurons are broadly tuned
              to odors. Iontophoresed glutamate hyperpolarizes all major cell
              types in the antennal lobe, and this effect is blocked by
              picrotoxin or by transgenic RNAi-mediated knockdown of the
              GluCl$\alpha$ gene, which encodes a glutamate-gated chloride
              channel. Moreover, antennal lobe neurons are inhibited by
              selective activation of glutamatergic local neurons using a
              nonnative genetically encoded cation channel. Finally, transgenic
              knockdown of GluCl$\alpha$ in principal neurons disinhibits the
              odor responses of these neurons. Thus, glutamate acts as an
              inhibitory neurotransmitter in the antennal lobe, broadly similar
              to the role of GABA in this circuit. However, because glutamate
              release is concentrated between glomeruli, whereas GABA release
              is concentrated within glomeruli, these neurotransmitters may act
              on different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, the existence of

              Here, we address these issues in antennal lobe projection
              neurons, one of the most well studied classes of Drosophila
              neurons. We use morphological and electrophysiological data to
              deduce the passive membrane properties of these neurons and to
              build a compartmental model of their electrotonic structure. We
              find that these neurons are electrotonically extensive and that a
              somatic recording electrode can only imperfectly control the
              voltage in the rest of the cell. Simulations predict that action
              potentials initiate at a location distant from the soma, in the
              proximal portion of the axon. Simulated synaptic input to a
              single dendritic branch propagates poorly to the rest of the cell
              and cannot match the size of real unitary synaptic events, but we
              can obtain a good fit to data when we model unitary input

              GABAergic synaptic inhibition is thought to play a critical role
              in olfactory processing in the antennal lobe and olfactory bulb.
              However, the properties of GABAergic neurons and the cellular
              effects of GABA have not been described in Drosophila, an
              important model organism for olfaction research. We have used
              whole-cell patch-clamp recording, pharmacology,

              GABAergic inhibition affects olfactory processing in the
              Drosophila antennal lobe. We show that many axonless local
              neurons (LNs) in the adult antennal lobe are GABAergic. GABA
              hyperpolarizes antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) via two

              The patterns of odor-evoked GABAB-mediated inhibition differ

              glomeruli that are coactivated by odors, and certain combinations
              of glomeruli are over-represented. One morphological LHN type is
              broadly tuned and sums input from multiple glomeruli. These
              neurons have a broader dynamic range than their individual
              glomerular inputs do. By contrast, a second morphological type is
              narrowly tuned and receives prominent odor-selective inhibition

              wiring scheme confers increased selectivity. The biased
              stereotyped connectivity of the lateral horn contrasts with the
              probabilistic wiring of the mushroom body, reflecting the

               food-seeking behavior. We have discovered five pathways in the

               Blocking the MB-intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) and the MB output

               Starvation bi-directionally modulates MBON responses to a food
               odor, suggesting that hunger and satiety controls occur at the
               KC-to-MBON synapses. These controls are mediated by six types of

              of the neurons--provides no information about population
              sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and
              lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding

              Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the

              The anterior touch circuitry changes in two ways as the animal

              perform more lateral stretches to compensate for the inability to
              stretch upright. Rats' propensity to burrow remained constant as

              because of declining physical ability. Upright standing decreased

              excitatory and inhibitory projection neurons (ePNs and iPNs)

              silence subsets of ePNs have graded behavioral consequences, and
              effect sizes are predicted by changes in ePN distances. ePN
              distances predict only innate, not learned, behavior because the

              capabilities of neuronal circuitry. Morphological features based
              on this tree structure have played a central role in classifying
              neurons for over a century. Yet geometrical trees are not
              automatically adapted to the basic mathematical tool used widely
              in data analysis, namely vector spaces and linear algebra, since
              tree geometries cannot be naturally added and subtracted. Current
              methods for analysis reduce trees to feature vectors in more or
              less ad hoc ways. A more natural mathematical object suited to
              characterizing neuronal tree geometries, is a metric space, where
              only distances between objects need be defined. In recent years,
              there have been significant developments in the fields of
              computational topology and geometry that promise to be useful for
              the analysis of neuronal geometries. In this paper, we adapt
              these tools to the problem of characterizing and analyzing
              neuronal morphology. As more and more neuroanatomical data are
              made available through efforts such as NeuroMorpho.org and
              FlyCircuit.org, the need to develop computational tools to
              facilitate automatic knowledge discovery from such large datasets
              becomes more urgent. One fundamental question is how best to
              compare neuron structures, for instance to organize and classify
              large collection of neurons. We aim to develop a flexible yet
              powerful framework to support comparison and classification of
              large collection of neuron structures efficiently. Specifically
              we propose to use a topological persistence-based feature
              vectorization framework. Existing methods to vectorize a neuron
              (i.e, convert a neuron to a feature vector so as to support
              efficient comparison and/or searching) typically rely on
              statistics or summaries of morphometric information, such as the
              average or maximum local torque angle or partition asymmetry.
              These simple summaries have limited power in encoding global tree
              structures. Leveraging recent development in topological data
              analysis, we vectorize each neuron structure into a simple yet
              informative summary via the use of topological persistence. In
              particular, each type of information of interest can be
              represented as a descriptor function defined on the neuron tree,
              which is then mapped to a simple persistence-signature. Our
              framework can encode both local and global tree structure, as
              well as other information of interest (electrophysiological or
              dynamical measures), by considering multiple descriptor functions
              on the neuron. The resulting persistence-based signature is
              potentially more informative than simple statistical summaries
              (such as average/mean/max) of morphometric quantities -- Indeed,
              we show that using a certain descriptor function will give a
              persistence-based signature containing strictly more information
              than the classical Sholl analysis. At the same time, our
              framework retains the efficiency associated with treating neurons
              as points in a simple Euclidean feature space, which would be
              important for constructing efficient searching or indexing
              structures over them. We present preliminary experimental results
              to demonstrate the effectiveness of our persistence-based
              neuronal feature vectorization framework.",

              the excitatory axon (presynaptic inhibition). That transmission
              is from the inhibitor to the excitor terminals at these
              axo-axonal synapses is indicated by the occurrence on the
              inhibitor membrane of presynaptic dense bars denoting sites of
              transmitter release. Axo-axonal synapses with the opposite
              polarity, in which transmission is from an excitatory onto an
              inhibitory terminal, were occasionally seen either adjacent to or
              separate from the inhibitory axo-axonal synapse. Nerve terminals
              of the specific inhibitor in the crayfish opener muscle were seen
              to make numerous axo-axonal output synapses upon excitatory nerve
              terminals but excitor nerve terminals were not seen to make
              output synapses onto inhibitor terminals. Thus reciprocal
              axo-axonal synapses appear to be a feature of the common
              inhibitor but not of the specific inhibitor. The
              excitor-to-inhibitor component of these reciprocal synapses may
              serve to limit transmitter output in the common inhibitor axon by
              activating glutamateB receptors which facilitate efflux of K+ and
              hyperpolarization of the membrane.",

              other aspects of sensory processing and locomotor control. Formed
              by the merging of four neuromeres, the internal architecture of
              the SEZ can be best understood by identifying segmentally
              reiterated landmarks emerging in the embryo and larva, and
              following the gradual changes by which these landmarks become
              integrated into the mature SEZ during metamorphosis. In previous
              works, the system of longitudinal fibers (connectives) and
              transverse axons (commissures) has been used as a scaffold that
              provides internal landmarks for the neuromeres of the larval
              ventral nerve cord. We have extended the analysis of this
              scaffold to the SEZ and, in addition, reconstructed the tracts
              formed by lineages and nerves in relationship to the connectives
              and commissures. As a result, we establish reliable criteria that
              define boundaries between the four neuromeres (tritocerebrum,

              (somatosensory, BA3-1-2; motor, BA4), unimodal cortex (Wernicke's

              mentary motor area, BA6beta; angular gyrus, BA39) and supramodal
              cortex (superior frontopolar zone, BA10; inferior frontopolar
              zone, BA11). To capture more general aspects of regional
              variability, primary and unimodal areas were designated as low
              integrative regions; heteromodal and supramodal areas were
              designated as high integrative regions. Tissue was obtained from
              the left hemisphere of 10 neurologically normal individuals
              (M(age) = 30 +/- 17 years; five males, five females) and stained
              with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Ten neurons were sampled
              from each cortical region (n = 800) and evaluated according to
              total dendritic length, mean segment length, dendritic segment
              count, dendritic spine number and dendritic spine density.
              Despite considerable inter-individual variation, there were
              significant differences across the eight Brodmann's areas and
              between the high and low integrative regions for all dendritic
              and spine measures. Dendritic systems in primary and unimodal
              regions were consistently less complex than in heteromodal and
              supramodal areas. The range within these rankings was
              substantial, with total dendritic length in BA10 being 31\%
              greater than that in BA3-1-2, and dendritic spine number being
              69\% greater. These findings demonstrate that cortical regions
              involved in the early stages of processing (e.g. primary sensory
              areas) generally exhibit less complex dendritic/spine systems
              than those regions involved in the later stages of information
              processing (e.g. prefrontal cortex). This dendritic progression
              appears to reflect significant differences in the nature of
              cortical processing, with spine-dense neurons at hierarchically
              higher association levels integrating a broader range of synaptic
              input than those at lower cortical levels.",

              sequential divisions of neural stem cells, or neuroblasts. In the
              insect brain progeny of certain stem cells form lineage-specific
              sets of projections that arborize in distinct brain regions,
              called clonal units. Though this raises the possibility that the
              entire neural network in the brain might be organized in a
              clone-dependent fashion, only a small portion of clones has been
              identified. RESULTS: Using Drosophila melanogaster, we randomly
              labeled one of about 100 stem cells at the beginning of the
              larval stage, analyzed the projection patterns of their progeny
              in the adult, and identified 96 clonal units in the central part
              of the fly brain, the cerebrum. Neurons of all the clones
              arborize in distinct regions of the brain, though many clones
              feature heterogeneous groups of neurons in terms of their
              projection patterns and neurotransmitters. Arborizations of
              clones overlap preferentially to form several groups of closely
              associated clones. Fascicles and commissures were all made by
              unique sets of clones. Whereas well-investigated brain regions
              such as the mushroom body and central complex consist of
              relatively small numbers of clones and are specifically connected
              with a limited number of neuropils, seemingly disorganized
              neuropils surrounding them are composed by a much larger number
              of clones and have extensive specific connections with many other

              formed by a composition of cell-lineage-dependent modules. Clonal

              binding of volatile ligands to odorant receptors that belong to
              the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. They couple to
              heterotrimeric G-proteins, most of which induce cAMP production.
              This second messenger then activates cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion
              channels to depolarize the olfactory receptor neuron, thus
              providing a signal for further neuronal processing. Recent
              findings, however, have challenged this concept of odorant signal
              transduction in insects, because their odorant receptors, which
              lack any sequence similarity to other GPCRs, are composed of
              conventional odorant receptors (for example, Or22a), dimerized
              with a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein, such as Or83b in
              Drosophila. Or83b has a structure akin to GPCRs, but has an
              inverted orientation in the plasma membrane. However, G proteins
              are expressed in insect olfactory receptor neurons, and olfactory
              perception is modified by mutations affecting the cAMP
              transduction pathway. Here we show that application of odorants
              to mammalian cells co-expressing Or22a and Or83b results in
              non-selective cation currents activated by means of an ionotropic
              and a metabotropic pathway, and a subsequent increase in the
              intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Expression of Or83b alone
              leads to functional ion channels not directly responding to
              odorants, but being directly activated by intracellular cAMP or
              cGMP. Insect odorant receptors thus form ligand-gated channels as
              well as complexes of odorant-sensing units and
              cyclic-nucleotide-activated non-selective cation channels.
              Thereby, they provide rapid and transient as well as sensitive

              brain framework was required. We here present an average shaped
              atlas of the moth brain. It is based on 11 female brain
              preparations, each stained with a fluorescent synaptic marker and
              scanned in confocal laser-scanning microscope. Brain neuropils of
              each preparation were manually reconstructed in the computer
              software AMIRA, followed by generating the atlas using the
              Iterative Shape Average Procedure. To demonstrate the application
              of the atlas we have registered two olfactory and two gustatory
              interneurons, as well as the axonal projections of gustatory
              receptor neurons into the atlas, visualising their spatial
              relationships. The olfactory interneurons, showing the typical
              morphology of inner-tract antennal lobe projection neurons,
              projected in the calyces of the mushroom body and laterally in
              the protocerebral lobe. The two gustatory interneurons,
              responding to sucrose and quinine respectively, projected in
              different areas of the brain. The wide projections of the quinine
              responding neuron included a lateral area adjacent to the
              projections of the olfactory interneurons. The sucrose responding
              neuron was confined to the suboesophageal ganglion with dendritic
              arborizations overlapping the axonal projections of the gustatory
              receptor neurons on the proboscis. By serving as a tool for the
              integration of neurons, the atlas offers visual access to the
              spatial relationship between the neurons in three dimensions, and
              thus facilitates the study of neuronal networks in the Heliothis

              neuropil, the lateral accessory calyx (lACA), by reconstructing
              neurons downstream of heating- and cooling-responsive VP PNs. A
              few mushroom body-intrinsic neurons solely receive thermosensory

              involved in neurite outgrowth and differentiation, accurate and

              processes are a prerequisite. To facilitate this task, we
              developed a semiautomatic neurite tracing technique. This article
              describes the design and validation of the technique. METHODS:
              The technique was compared to fully manual delineation. Four
              observers repeatedly traced selected neurites in 20 fluorescence
              microscopy images of cells in culture, using both methods.
              Accuracy and reproducibility were determined by comparing the
              tracings to high-resolution reference tracings, using two error
              measures. Labor intensiveness was measured in numbers of mouse
              clicks required. The significance of the results was determined
              by a Student t-test and by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Both
              methods slightly underestimated the true neurite length, but the
              differences were not unanimously significant. The average
              deviation from the true neurite centerline was a factor 2.6
              smaller with the developed technique compared to fully manual
              tracing. Intraobserver variability in the respective measures was
              reduced by a factor 6.0 and 23.2. Interobserver variability was
              reduced by a factor 2.4 and 8.8, respectively, and labor
              intensiveness by a factor 3.3. CONCLUSIONS: Providing similar
              accuracy in measuring neurite length, significantly improved
              accuracy in neurite centerline extraction, and significantly
              improved reproducibility and reduced labor intensiveness, the
              developed technique may replace fully manual tracing methods.",

              enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at the level of
              individual synaptic connections. However, for invertebrates, such
              as Drosophila melanogaster , it has so far been unclear whether
              the phenotype of neurons or synapses alone is sufficient to
              predict specific functional properties such as neurotransmitter
              identity. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster
              artificial convolutional neural networks can confidently predict
              the type of neurotransmitter released at a synaptic site from EM
              images alone. The network successfully discriminates between six
              types of neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine,
              serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine) with an average accuracy of
              87\% for individual synapses and 94\% for entire neurons,
              assuming each neuron expresses only one neurotransmitter. This
              result is surprising as there are often no obvious cues in the EM
              images that human observers can use to predict neurotransmitter
              identity. We apply the proposed method to quantify whether,
              similar to the ventral nervous system (VNS), all hemilineages in
              the Drosophila melanogaster brain express only one fast acting
              transmitter within their neurons. To test this principle, we
              predict the neurotransmitter identity of all identified synapses
              in 89 hemilineages in the Drosophila melanogaster adult brain.
              While the majority of our predictions show homogeneity of
              fast-acting neurotransmitter identity within a single
              hemilineage, we identify a set of hemilineages that express two
              fast-acting neurotransmitters with high statistical significance.
              As a result, our predictions are inconsistent with the hypothesis
              that all neurons within a hemilineage express the same
              fast-acting neurotransmitter in the brain of Drosophila

              In the olfactory system, two coexpressed ionotropic receptors

              Accordingly, these animals must instinctively move to places with

              regulatory programmes remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we
              use whole-organism single-cell RNA sequencing to map
              cell-type-specific transcription in Porifera (sponges),
              Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Placozoa species. We describe the
              repertoires of cell types in these non-bilaterian animals,
              uncovering diverse instances of previously unknown molecular
              signatures, such as multiple types of peptidergic cells in
              Placozoa. Analysis of the regulatory programmes of these cell
              types reveals variable levels of complexity. In placozoans and
              poriferans, sequence motifs in the promoters are predictive of
              cell-type-specific programmes. By contrast, the generation of a
              higher diversity of cell types in ctenophores is associated with
              lower specificity of promoter sequences and the existence of
              distal regulatory elements. Our findings demonstrate that
              metazoan cell types can be defined by networks of transcription
              factors and proximal promoters, and indicate that further genome
              regulatory complexity may be required for more diverse cell type
              repertoires.",

               images of fluorescence microscopy plays an increasingly
               important role in high-content screenings. However, there exist
               very few freeware tools and methods which provide automatic
               neuronal morphology quantification for pharmacological
               discovery. RESULTS: This study proposes an effective
               quantification method, called NeurphologyJ, capable of
               automatically quantifying neuronal morphologies such as soma
               number and size, neurite length, and neurite branching
               complexity (which is highly related to the numbers of attachment
               points and ending points). NeurphologyJ is implemented as a
               plugin to ImageJ, an open-source Java-based image processing and
               analysis platform. The high performance of NeurphologyJ arises
               mainly from an elegant image enhancement method. Consequently,
               some morphology operations of image processing can be
               efficiently applied. We evaluated NeurphologyJ by comparing it
               with both the computer-aided manual tracing method NeuronJ and
               an existing ImageJ-based plugin method NeuriteTracer. Our
               results reveal that NeurphologyJ is comparable to NeuronJ, that
               the coefficient correlation between the estimated neurite
               lengths is as high as 0.992. NeurphologyJ can accurately measure
               neurite length, soma number, neurite attachment points, and
               neurite ending points from a single image. Furthermore, the
               quantification result of nocodazole perturbation is consistent
               with its known inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth. We were
               also able to calculate the IC50 of nocodazole using
               NeurphologyJ. This reveals that NeurphologyJ is effective enough
               to be utilized in applications of pharmacological discoveries.
               CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes an automatic and fast neuronal
               quantification method NeurphologyJ. The ImageJ plugin with
               supports of batch processing is easily customized for dealing
               with high-content screening applications. The source codes of

              third-order neurons read this odor map remained unknown. RESULTS:
              Using the Drosophila brain as a model system, we analyzed the
              connectivity patterns between second-order and third-order
              olfactory neurons. We first isolated three common projection
              zones in the two secondary centers, the mushroom body (MB) and
              the lateral horn (LH). Each zone receives converged information
              via second-order neurons from particular subgroups of
              antennal-lobe glomeruli. In the MB, third-order neurons extend
              their dendrites across various combinations of these zones, and
              axons of this heterogeneous population of neurons converge in the
              output region of the MB. In contrast, arborizations of the
              third-order neurons in the LH are constrained within a zone.
              Moreover, different zones of the LH are linked with different
              brain areas and form preferential associations between distinct
              subsets of antennal-lobe glomeruli and higher brain regions.
              CONCLUSIONS: MB is known to be an indispensable site for
              olfactory learning and memory, whereas LH function is reported to
              be sufficient for mediating direct nonassociative responses to
              odors. The structural organization of second-order and
              third-order neurons suggests that MB is capable of integrating a
              wide range of odorant information across glomeruli, whereas
              relatively little integration between different subsets of the

              Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that

              Drosophila, the fertilization of uninfected eggs by sperm from

              to adulthood. Using a combinatorial rearing protocol, we provide
              evidence for such a female-to-male communication during
              metamorphosis. This communication involves the perception of
              female pheromones by male olfactory receptors. We found that this
              communication determines the compatibility range of sperm.
              Wolbachia interfere with this female-to-male communication
              through changes in female pheromone production. Strikingly,
              restoring this communication partially suppressed CI in
              Wolbachia-infected males. We further identified a reciprocal
              male-to-female communication at metamorphosis that restricts the
              compatibility range of female gametes. Wolbachia also perturb
              this communication by feminizing male pheromone production. Thus,
              Wolbachia broaden the compatibility range of eggs, promoting
              thereby the reproductive success of Wolbachia-infected females.
              We conclude that pheromone communication between pupae regulates
              gamete compatibility and is sensitive to Wolbachia in Drosophila.",

              identical pheromone responses, suggesting that sex genes
              differentially wire circuits deeper in the brain. Using in vivo
              whole-cell electrophysiology, we now show that two clusters of
              third-order olfactory neurons have dimorphic pheromone responses.
              One cluster responds in females; the other responds in males.
              These clusters are present in both sexes and share a common input
              pathway, but sex-specific wiring reroutes pheromone information.
              Regulating dendritic position, the fruitless transcription factor
              both connects the male-responsive cluster and disconnects the
              female-responsive cluster from pheromone input. Selective
              masculinization of third-order neurons transforms their

              surfaces that were previously segmented and labeled in a group of
              subjects. The method estimates an anatomical model, the template
              complex, that is representative of the population under study.
              Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In
              addition, the method automatically places control points near the
              most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to
              these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D
              space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's
              complex in a way that preserves the organization of the
              anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is
              applied to these deformation parameters to test for group
              differences. Results of the statistical analysis are then
              expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template
              complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs
              only to specify the topology of the template complex and the
              number of control points. The method then automatically estimates
              the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of
              control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach
              is completely generic with respect to any type of application and
              well adapted to efficient use in clinical studies, in that it
              does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is
              robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent
              orientation or irregular meshing. The approach is illustrated
              with a neuroimaging study of Down syndrome (DS). The results
              demonstrate that the complex of deep brain structures shows a
              statistically significant shape difference between control and DS
              subjects. The deformation-based modelingis able to classify
              subjects with very high specificity and sensitivity, thus showing
              important generalization capability even given a low sample size.
              We show that the results remain significant even if the number of
              control points, and hence the dimension of variables in the
              statistical model, are drastically reduced. The analysis may even

              electrode were recorded simultaneously from many loci in the

              gray horns. The optical signals were composed of two components,
              fast spike-like and slow signals. In the dorsal region, the fast
              spike-like signal was identified as the presynaptic action
              potential in the sensory nerve and the slow signal as the
              postsynaptic potential. In the ventral region, the fast
              spike-like signal reflects the antidromic action potential in
              motoneurons, and the slow signal is related to the postsynaptic
              potential evoked in the motoneuron. In preparations in which the

               shape neuronal design. Here, we focus on a particularly

               the auditory brainstem. Based on a modeling approach, we show

              Farnesol is an intermediate in juvenile hormone biosynthesis, but

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Much of our understanding of how neural networks
              develop is based on studies of sensory systems, revealing often
              highly stereotyped patterns of connections, particularly as these
              diverge from the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. We
              know considerably less about the wiring strategies of motor
              networks, where connections converge onto the dendrites of
              motoneurons. Here, we investigated patterns of synaptic
              connections between identified motoneurons with sensory neurons
              and interneurons in the motor network of the Drosophila larva and
              how these change as it develops. RESULTS: We find that as animals
              grow, motoneurons increase the number of synapses with existing
              presynaptic partners. Different motoneurons form characteristic
              cell-type-specific patterns of connections. At the same time,
              there is considerable variability in the number of synapses
              formed on motoneuron dendrites, which contrasts with the
              stereotypy reported for presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons.
              Where two motoneurons of the same cell type contact a common
              interneuron partner, each postsynaptic cell can arrive at a
              different connectivity outcome. Experimentally changing the
              positioning of motoneuron dendrites shows that the geography of
              dendritic arbors in relation to presynaptic partner terminals is
              an important determinant in shaping patterns of connectivity.
              CONCLUSIONS: In the Drosophila larval motor network, the sets of
              connections that form between identified neurons manifest an
              unexpected level of variability. Synapse number and the
              likelihood of forming connections appear to be regulated on a
              cell-by-cell basis, determined primarily by the postsynaptic

              neuromeres develop from populations of neural stem cells
              (neuroblasts) that delaminate from the early embryonic
              neuroectoderm in a stereotyped spatial and temporal pattern.
              Pattern units closely resemble the ground state and are rather
              invariant in thoracic (T1-T3) and anterior abdominal (A1-A7)
              segments of the embryonic ventral nerve cord. Here, we provide a
              comprehensive neuroblast map of the terminal abdominal neuromeres
              A8-A10, which exhibit a progressively derived character. Compared
              with thoracic and anterior abdominal segments, neuroblast numbers
              are reduced by 28\% in A9 and 66\% in A10 and are almost entirely
              absent in the posterior compartments of these segments. However,
              all neuroblasts formed exhibit serial homology to their

              their survival, but not proliferation, in males. These data

              melanogaster has revealed a total of 35 glomeruli, of which 30
              are located in the periphery of the lobe and 5 in its center.
              Several prominent glomeruli are recognizable by their location,
              size, and shape; others are identifiable only by their positions
              relative to prominent glomeruli. No obvious sexual dimorphism of
              the glomerular architecture was observed. Golgi impregnations
              revealed: (1) Five of the glomeruli are exclusive targets for
              ipsilateral antennal input, whereas all others receive afferents
              from both antennae. Unilateral amputation of the third antennal
              segment led to a loss of about 1000 fibers in the antennal
              commissure. Hence, about 5/6 of the approximately 1200 antennal
              afferents per side have a process that extends into the
              contralateral lobe. (2) Afferents from maxillary palps (most
              likely from basiconic sensilla) project into both ipsi- and
              contralateral antennal lobes, yet their target glomeruli are
              apparently not the same as those of antennal basiconic sensilla.
              (3) Afferents in the antennal lobe may also stem from pharyngeal
              sensilla. (4) The most prominent types of interneurons with
              arborizations in the antennal lobe are: (i) local interneurons
              ramifying in the entire lobe, (ii) unilateral relay interneurons

              protocerebrum (LPR), (iii) unilateral interneurons that connect

              that link a small number of glomeruli in both antennal lobes with
              the calyx and LPR, (v) giant bilateral interneurons characterized
              by extensive ramifications in both antennal lobes and the
              posterior brain and a cell body situated in the midline of the
              suboesophageal ganglion, and (vi) a unilateral interneuron with
              extensive arborization in one antennal lobe and the posterior
              brain and a process that extends into the thorax. These

               Identifying the exact network of synaptic connections, or
               connectome, of the fly's central nervous system is now a major
               objective in Drosophila neurobiology, one that has been
               initiated in several laboratories, especially the Janelia
               Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Progress
               is most advanced in the optic neuropiles of the visual system.
               The effort to derive a connectome from these and other neuropile
               regions is proceeding by various methods of electron microscopy,
               especially focused-ion beam milling scanning electron
               microscopy, and relies upon - but is to be carefully
               distinguished from - published light microscopic methods that
               reveal the projections of genetically labelled cell types. The
               latter reveal those neurons that come into close proximity and
               are therefore candidate synaptic partners. Synaptic partnerships
               are not in fact reliably revealed by such candidate pairs,
               anatomical connections often revealing unexpected pathways.
               Synaptic partnerships identified from ultrastructural features
               provide a strong heuristic basis to interpret not only
               functional interactions between identified neurons, but also a
               powerful means to predict such interactions, and suggest
               functional pathways not readily predicted from existing
               experimental evidence. The analysis of circuit function may
               proceed cell by cell, by examining the behavioural outcome of
               either interrupting or restoring function to any one element in
               an anatomically defined circuit, but can be foiled by degeneracy
               in pathway elements. Circuit information can also be used to
               identify and analyse circuit motifs, and their role in
               higher-order network properties. These attempts in Drosophila
               anticipate parallel attempts in other systems, notably the inner
               plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina, and augment the one

              physiological responses to odors, and MB silencing experiments.
              Direct evidence for the functional role of the LH is still

              behavioral response to other odors indicate the neurons are
              selective to CO2 response. Using calcium imaging, we observe that

              Using independent manipulation and recording of the two sets of

               of pre-clinical treatment strategies should be tested in animal
               models, in vitro assays are usually faster and less expensive.
               As a result, in vitro models are ideal for screening large
               numbers of potential therapeutics prior to use in more complex
               in vivo systems. In 1953, Sholl introduced a technique that is a
               reliable and sensitive method for quantifying indices of neurite
               outgrowth. However, application of the technique is limited
               because it is labor-intensive. Several methods have been
               developed to reduce the analysis time for the Sholl technique;
               but these methods require extensive pre-processing of digital
               images, they introduce user bias or they have not been compared
               to manual analysis to ensure accuracy. Here we describe a new,
               semi-automated Sholl technique for quantifying neuronal and
               glial process morphology. Using MetaMorph\textregistered{}, we
               developed an unbiased analysis protocol that can be performed
               ∼3$\times$ faster than manual quantification with a comparable
               level of accuracy regardless of cell morphology. The laborious
               image processing typical of most computer-aided analysis is
               avoided by embedding image correction functions into the
               automated portion of the analysis. The sensitivity and validity
               of the technique was confirmed by quantifying neuron growth
               treated with growth factors or oligodendroglial maturation in
               the presence or absence of thyroid hormone. Thus, this technique
               provides a rapid and sensitive method for quantifying changes in

              glomeruli (``coding channels'') in the brain. However, the odor
              tuning of a glomerulus is not strongly correlated with its
              spatial position. This raises the question of whether lateral
              inhibition between glomeruli is specific or nonspecific. Here we
              show that, in the Drosophila brain, focal activation of even a
              single glomerulus recruits GABAergic interneurons in all
              glomeruli. Moreover, the relative level of interneuron activity
              in different glomeruli is largely odor invariant. Although
              interneurons are recruited nonspecifically, glomeruli differ
              dramatically in their sensitivity to interneuron activity, and
              this is explained by their varying sensitivity to GABA.
              Interestingly, a stimulus is typically encoded in parallel by
              channels having high and low sensitivity to inhibition. Because
              lateral inhibition confers both costs and benefits, the brain

              neurons (OSNs) encode odors has hindered the progress in
              understanding the olfactory signal processing in higher brain
              centers. Here we employ methods of system identification to
              investigate the encoding of time-varying odor stimuli and their
              representation for further processing in the spike domain by
              Drosophila OSNs. In order to apply system identification
              techniques, we built a novel low-turbulence odor delivery system
              that allowed us to deliver airborne stimuli in a precise and
              reproducible fashion. The system provides a 1\% tolerance in
              stimulus reproducibility and an exact control of odor
              concentration and concentration gradient on a millisecond time
              scale. Using this novel setup, we recorded and analyzed the
              in-vivo response of OSNs to a wide range of time-varying odor
              waveforms. We report for the first time that across trials the
              response of OR59b OSNs is very precise and reproducible. Further,
              we empirically show that the response of an OSN depends not only
              on the concentration, but also on the rate of change of the odor
              concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional
              (2D) Encoding Manifold in a concentration-concentration gradient
              space provides a quantitative description of the neuron's
              response. We then use the white noise system identification
              methodology to construct one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
              (2D) Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade models of the sensory
              neuron for a fixed mean odor concentration and fixed contrast. We
              show that in terms of predicting the intensity rate of the spike
              train, the 2D LNP model performs on par with the 1D LNP model,
              with a root mean-square error (RMSE) increase of about 5 to 10\%.
              Surprisingly, we find that for a fixed contrast of the white
              noise odor waveforms, the nonlinear block of each of the two
              models changes with the mean input concentration. The shape of
              the nonlinearities of both the 1D and the 2D LNP model appears to
              be, for a fixed mean of the odor waveform, independent of the
              stimulus contrast. This suggests that white noise system
              identification of Or59b OSNs only depends on the first moment of
              the odor concentration. Finally, by comparing the 2D Encoding
              Manifold and the 2D LNP model, we demonstrate that the OSN
              identification results depend on the particular type of the
              employed test odor waveforms. This suggests an adaptive neural
              encoding model for Or59b OSNs that changes its nonlinearity in
              response to the odor concentration waveforms.",

              in characteristic branching patterns. There, they contact the
              antennal axons. Connections are both convergent and divergent.
              Not only do single central neurons collect the inputs from many
              receptor cells, but receptor axons were often observed to branch
              and terminate at more than one deutocerebral neuron. The axons
              from a portion of the neurons go to form the deutocerebral bundle
              of the tractus olfactorio-globularis. These axons of the bundle
              terminate in the ipsilateral calyx of the corpus pedunculatum and
              in the lateral lobus protocerebri. The processes of the majority

              data, anatomical details such as con- and divergence of input and

              representing the earliest chordate lineage. This view is mainly

              increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative
              to tunicates. Despite their critical importance for understanding
              the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies of chordate

              specifically matched and tuned cell-to-cell connections that are
              essential for proper function. The mechanisms by which
              presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites recognize
              each other and establish the correct number of connections are
              still incompletely understood. Sperry's chemoaffinity hypothesis
              proposes that pre- and postsynaptic partners express specific
              combinations of molecules that enable them to recognize each
              other. Alternatively, Peters' rule proposes that presynaptic
              axons and postsynaptic dendrites use non-partner-derived global
              positional cues to independently reach their target area, and
              once there they randomly connect with any available neuron. These
              connections can then be further refined by additional mechanisms
              based on synaptic activity. We used the tractable genetic model
              system, the Drosophila embryo and larva, to test these hypotheses
              and elucidate the roles of 1) global positional cues, 2)
              partner-derived cues and 3) synaptic activity in the
              establishment of selective connections in the developing nerve
              cord. We altered the position or activity of presynaptic partners
              and analyzed the effect of these manipulations on the number of
              synapses with specific postsynaptic partners, strength of
              functional connections, and behavior controlled by these neurons.
              For this purpose, we combined developmental live imaging,
              electron microscopy reconstruction of circuits, functional
              imaging of neuronal activity, and behavioral experiments in
              wildtype and experimental animals. We found that postsynaptic
              dendrites are able to find, recognize, and connect to their
              presynaptic partners even when these have been shifted to ectopic
              locations through the overexpression of receptors for midline
              guidance cues. This suggests that neurons use partner-derived
              cues that allow them to identify and connect to each other.
              However, while partner-derived cues are sufficient for
              recognition between specific partners and establishment of
              connections;; without orderly positioning of axon terminals by
              positional cues and without synaptic activity during embryonic
              development, the numbers of functional connections are altered
              with significant consequences for behavior. Thus, multiple
              mechanisms including global positional cues, partner-derived
              cues, and synaptic activity contribute to proper circuit assembly

              cuticle lining of the pharyngeal lumen may aid in the
              accumulation of food particles. A basement membrane isolates the
              pharynx from the rest of the animal, making the pharyngeal
              nervous system a nearly self-contained unit which is composed
              primarily of five classes of motor neurones and six classes of
              interneurones. Three other classes have also been described,
              which by their morphology appear to be neurosecretory and motor,
              motor and interneuronal, and lastly one pair that only innervates
              three of the marginal cells. Some classes of neurone have free
              endings just under the cuticle lining the lumen of the pharynx,
              suggesting that these are mechano- or proprio-receptive endings.
              The connectivity of these neurones has been described at the

               NeuriteTracer, a neurite tracing plugin for the freely available

              the calyces supply a pedunculus and lobes divided into

              adapted to different ecologies, and likely to serve various
              functions. In insects whose derived life styles preclude the
              detection of airborne odorants, there is a loss of the antennal
              lobes and attenuation or loss of the calyces. Such taxa retain
              mushroom body lobes that are as elaborate as those of mushroom
              bodies equipped with calyces. Antennal lobe loss and calycal
              regression also typify taxa with short nonfeeding adults, in

              fundamental problem in neurobiology. In Drosophila, most odorants
              elicit attraction or avoidance depending on their concentration,
              as well as their identity [1]. Such odorants, moreover, typically
              activate combinations of glomeruli in the antennal lobe of the
              brain [2-4], complicating the dissection of the circuits
              translating odor recognition into behavior. Carbon dioxide (CO2),
              in contrast, elicits avoidance over a wide range of
              concentrations [5, 6] and activates only a single glomerulus, V
              [5]. The V glomerulus receives projections from olfactory
              receptor neurons (ORNs) that coexpress two GPCRs, Gr21a and
              Gr63a, that together comprise a CO2 receptor [7-9]. These
              CO2-sensitive ORNs, located in the ab1 sensilla of the antenna,
              are called ab1c neurons [10]. Genetic silencing of ab1c neurons
              indicates that they are necessary for CO2-avoidance behavior [5].
              Whether activation of these neurons alone is sufficient to elicit
              this behavior, or whether CO2 avoidance requires additional
              inputs (e.g., from the respiratory system), remains unclear.
              Here, we show that artificial stimulation of ab1c neurons with
              light (normally attractive to flies) elicits the avoidance
              behavior typical of CO2. Thus, avoidance behavior appears

               The mechanisms underlying sensitivity regulation in insect
               primary olfactory neurons are poorly understood. Here we reveal
               that dephosphorylation of OrcoS289 that occurs upon prolonged
               odor exposure is a mechanism underlying reduction in odorant
               sensitivity in Drosophila primary olfactory neurons in both
               sexes. OrcoS289A mutants, unable to phosphorylate this position,
               have low intrinsic odorant sensitivity that is independent of
               altered expression or localization. A phosphomimetic allele,
               OrcoS289D , has enhanced odorant sensitivity compared with
               wild-type controls. To explore the functional ramifications of
               this phosphorylation in vivo, we generated phospho-specific
               antiserum to OrcoS289 and show that phosphorylation at this

               concomitant modulation of odorant sensitivity. OrcoS289 is
               phosphorylated in the sensitized state, and odorant exposure

              stereotyped lineage of neurons which innervate specific
              compartments of the brain. Neuroblasts undergo two rounds of
              mitotic activity: embryonic divisions produce lineages of primary
              neurons that build the larval nervous system; after a brief
              quiescence, the neuroblasts go through a second round of
              divisions in larval stage to produce secondary neurons which are
              integrated into the adult nervous system. Here we investigate the
              lineages that are associated with the larval antennal lobe, one
              of the most widely studied neuronal systems in fly. We find that
              the same five neuroblasts responsible for the adult antennal lobe
              also produce the antennal lobe of the larval brain. However,
              there are notable differences in the composition of larval
              (primary) lineages and their adult (secondary) counterparts.
              Significantly, in the adult, two lineages (lNB/BAlc and
              adNB/BAmv3) produce uniglomerular projection neurons connecting
              the antennal lobe with the mushroom body and lateral horn;
              another lineage, vNB/BAla1, generates multiglomerular neurons
              reaching the lateral horn directly. lNB/BAlc, as well as a fourth
              lineage, vlNB/BAla2, generate a diversity of local interneurons.
              We describe a fifth, previously unknown lineage, BAlp4, which
              connects the posterior part of the antennal lobe and the
              neighboring tritocerebrum (gustatory center) with a higher brain
              center located adjacent to the mushroom body. In the larva, only
              one of these lineages, adNB/BAmv3, generates all uniglomerular
              projection neurons. Also as in the adult, lNB/BAlc and vlNB/BAla2
              produce local interneurons which, in terms of diversity in
              architecture and transmitter expression, resemble their adult
              counterparts. In addition, lineages lNB/BAlc and vNB/BAla1, as
              well as the newly described BAlp4, form numerous types of

              we show here that in a local network of about 600 pyramidal cells
              located within a cylindrical volume of 200 microm x 200 microm of
              neocortical layer 2/3, an individual pyramidal cell receives
              synaptic inputs from about 30 other pyramidal neurons, with the
              majority of EPSP amplitudes in the 0.2-1.0 mV range. The
              probability of connection decreased from 0.09 to 0.01 with
              intercell distance (over the range 25-200 microm). Within the
              same volume, local interneuron (fast-spiking non-accommodating
              interneuron, FS)-pyramidal cell connections were about 10 times
              more numerous, with the majority of connections being reciprocal.
              The probability of excitatory and inhibitory connections between
              pyramidal cells and FS interneurons decreased only slightly with
              distance, being in the range 0.5-0.75. Pyramidal cells in the
              local network received strong synaptic input during stimulation
              of afferent fibres in layers 1 and 6. Minimal-like stimulation of
              layer 1 or layer 6 inputs simultaneously induced postsynaptic
              potentials in connected pyramidal cells as well as in
              pyramidal-FS cell pairs. These inputs readily induced firing of
              pyramidal cells, although synaptically connected cells displayed
              different firing patterns. Unitary EPSPs in pyramidal-pyramidal
              cell pairs did not detectably alter cell firing. FS interneurons
              fire simultaneously with pyramidal cells. In pyramidal-FS cell
              pairs, both unitary EPSPs and IPSPs efficiently modulated cell
              firing patterns. We suggest that computation in the local network
              may proceed not only by direct pyramidal-pyramidal cell
              communication but also via local interneurons. With such a high
              degree of connectivity with surrounding pyramidal cells, local

  abstract  = "This article describes simulations on populations of neural
               networks that both evolve at the population level and learn at
               the individual level. Unlike other simulations, the evolutionary
               task (finding food in the environment) and the learning task
               (predicting the next position of food on the basis of present
               position and planned network's movement) are different tasks. In
               these conditions, learning influences evolution (without
               Lamarckian inheritance of learned weight changes) and evolution
               influences learning. Average but not peak fitness has a better
               evolutionary growth with learning than without learning. After
               the initial generations, individuals that learn to predict
               during life also improve their food-finding ability during life.
               Furthermore, individuals that inherit an innate capacity to find
               food also inherit an innate predisposition to learn to predict
               the sensory consequences of their movements. They do not predict
               better at birth, but they do learn to predict better than
               individuals of the initial generation given the same learning
               experience. The results are interpreted in terms of a notion of
               dynamic correlation between the fitness surface and the learning
               surface. Evolution succeeds in finding both individuals that
               have high fitness and individuals that, although they do not

              the odor-response profiles for four odorant receptors (Or10a,
              Or42b, Or47b, Or56a). We deorphanize Or69a, showing a broad

              3-hydroxyhexanoate, alpha-terpineol, 3-octanol and linalool. We

  abstract = "Insects, like many other animals, use sex pheromones to
              coordinate their reproductive behaviours. Volatile pheromones are
              detected by odorant receptors expressed in olfactory receptor
              neurons (ORNs). Whereas fruit odours typically activate multiple
              ORN classes, pheromones are thought to act through single
              dedicated classes of ORN. This model predicts that activation of
              such an ORN class should be sufficient to trigger the appropriate
              behavioural response. Here we show that the Drosophila
              melanogaster male-specific pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate
              (cVA) acts through the receptor Or67d to regulate both male and

              inappropriately court other males, whereas mutant females are
              less receptive to courting males. These data suggest that cVA has
              opposite effects in the two sexes: inhibiting mating behaviour in
              males but promoting mating behaviour in females. Replacing Or67d
              with moth pheromone receptors renders these ORNs sensitive to the
              corresponding moth pheromones. In such flies, moth pheromones
              elicit behavioural responses that mimic the normal response to
              cVA. Thus, activation of a single ORN class is both necessary and

               profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a
               balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction
               time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic
               compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in
               the construction process, can be directly attributed to
               developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within
               its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are
               implemented in an open-source software package, the ``TREES

               manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a

               and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic
               morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks.
               These approaches provide new insights into the constraints

              olfactory memories. These neurons are required for aversive

              demonstrate that PD2a1 and PD2b1 neurons also receive direct
              input from food odor-encoding neurons. Consistent with this,
              PD2a1 and PD2b1 are also necessary for unlearned attraction to
              some odors, indicating that these neurons have a dual behavioral

               target be stored, especially in case the target moves out of
               sight. The capability to retain, recall and integrate such
               positional information into guiding behaviour has been
               summarized under the term spatial working memory. This kind of
               memory contains specific details of the presence that are not
               necessarily part of a long-term memory. Neurophysiological
               studies in primates indicate that sustained activity of neurons
               encodes the sensory information even though the object is no
               longer present. Furthermore they suggest that dopamine transmits
               the respective input to the prefrontal cortex, and simultaneous
               suppression by GABA spatially restricts this neuronal activity.
               Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster possesses a similar
               spatial memory during locomotion. Using a new detour setup, we
               show that flies can remember the position of an object for
               several seconds after it has been removed from their
               environment. In this setup, flies are temporarily lured away
               from the direction towards their hidden target, yet they are
               thereafter able to aim for their former target. Furthermore, we
               find that the GABAergic (stainable with antibodies against GABA)
               ring neurons of the ellipsoid body in the central brain are
               necessary and their plasticity is sufficient for a functional
               spatial orientation memory in flies. We also find that the
               protein kinase S6KII (ignorant) is required in a distinct subset
               of ring neurons to display this memory. Conditional expression
               of S6KII in these neurons only in adults can restore the loss of
               the orientation memory of the ignorant mutant. The S6KII

               handful of spikes in a single ORN type is sufficient to trigger
               these behaviors. Finally, we found that the upwind turn is
               triggered independently from the increase in wingbeat frequency,

               branch number estimate from complex arbors with numerous
               neurite-to-neurite contacts, without creating a precise,
               contact-free representation of the neurite arbor. It estimates
               total neurite length, branch number, primary neurite number,
               territory (the area of the convex polygon bounding the skeleton
               and cell body), and Polarity Index (a measure of neuronal

               about the size and shape of neurite arbors, which are critical
               factors for neuronal function. NeuronMetrics streamlines
               optional manual tasks such as removing noise, isolating the

               avoids user interventions by first automatically identifying the

               to the end points in an image stack. In the proposed algorithm,
               a tailor-made weighting function allows the resulting

              is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence

              the cortical architecture in newborns of these species. To this
              end, the current study examined the morphology of neurons from
              several cortical areas in the newborn giraffe and elephant. After
              cortical neurons were stained with a modified Golgi technique (N
              = 153), dendritic branching and spine distributions were analyzed
              by using computer-assisted morphometry. The results showed that
              newborn elephant neurons were considerably larger in terms of all
              dendritic and spine measures than newborn giraffe neurons.
              Qualitatively, neurons in the newborns appeared morphologically
              comparable to those in their adult counterparts. Neurons in the
              newborn elephant differed considerably from those observed in
              other placental mammals, including the giraffe, particularly with
              regard to the morphology of spiny projection neurons. Projection
              neurons were observed in both species, with a much larger variety
              in the elephant (e.g., flattened pyramidal, nonpyramidal
              multipolar, and inverted pyramidal neurons). Although local
              circuit neurons (i.e., interneurons, neurogliaform, Cajal-Retzius
              neurons) resembled those observed in other eutherian mammals,
              these were usually spiny, which contrasts with their adult,
              aspiny equivalents. Newborn projection neurons were smaller than
              the adult equivalents in both species, but newborn interneurons
              were approximately the same size as their adult counterparts.
              Cortical neuromorphology in the newborn giraffe is thus generally
              consistent with what has been observed in other cetartiodactyls,
              whereas newborn and adult elephant morphology appears to deviate

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Odors are detected by sensory neurons that carry
              information to the olfactory lobe where they connect to
              projection neurons and local interneurons in glomeruli:
              anatomically well-characterized structures that collect,
              integrate and relay information to higher centers. Recent studies
              have revealed that the sensitivity of such networks can be
              modulated by wide-field feedback neurons. The connectivity and
              function of such feedback neurons are themselves subject to
              alteration by external cues, such as hormones, stress, or
              experience. Very little is known about how this class of central
              neurons changes its anatomical properties to perform functions in
              altered developmental contexts. A mechanistic understanding of
              how central neurons change their anatomy to meet new functional
              requirements will benefit greatly from the establishment of a
              model preparation where cellular and molecular changes can be
              examined in an identified central neuron. RESULTS: In this study,
              we examine a wide-field serotonergic neuron in the Drosophila
              olfactory pathway and map the dramatic changes that it undergoes
              from larva to adult. We show that expression of a
              dominant-negative form of the ecdysterone receptor prevents
              remodeling. We further use different transgenic constructs to
              silence neuronal activity and report defects in the morphology of
              the adult-specific dendritic trees. The branching of the
              presynaptic axonal arbors is regulated by mechanisms that affect
              axon growth and retrograde transport. The neuron develops its
              normal morphology in the absence of sensory input to the antennal
              lobe, or of the mushroom bodies. However, ablation of its
              presumptive postsynaptic partners, the projection neurons and/or
              local interneurons, affects the growth and branching of terminal
              arbors. CONCLUSION: Our studies establish a cellular system for
              studying remodeling of a central neuromodulatory feedback neuron
              and also identify key elements in this process. Understanding the
              morphogenesis of such neurons, which have been shown in other
              systems to modulate the sensitivity and directionality of
              response to odors, links anatomy to the development of olfactory
              behavior.",

              antennal lobe, the primary integration center of odor
              information. Even minute scents of female pheromone are detected
              by male moths, facilitated by a huge array of pheromone receptors
              on their antennae. The associated neuropilar areas in the
              antennal lobe, the glomeruli, are enlarged in males and organized
              in the form of the so-called macroglomerular complex (MGC). In

              downstream in the olfactory pathway and in other neuropil areas
              in the central brain. Based on freshly eclosed animals, we
              created a volumetric female and male standard brain and compared
              30 separate neuropilar regions. Additionally, we labeled 10
              female glomeruli that were homologous to previously

              summary, the neuropil volumes reveal an isometric sexual
              dimorphism in M. sexta brains. This proportional size difference

              circadian rhythm research. Its circadian clock is located in the
              accessory medulla of the brain. Pigment-dispersing
              factor-immunoreactive (PDF-ir) neurons of the accessory medulla
              act as circadian pacemakers controlling locomotor activity
              rhythms. To characterize the neuronal network of the circadian
              system in L. maderae, the PDF-ir neurons were implemented into a
              standardized three-dimensional atlas of the cockroach brain.
              Serial confocal images from 20 wholemount brains were used for
              the construction of the atlas comprising 21 neuropils. Two
              different standardization protocols were employed: the iterative
              shape averaging (ISA) procedure using an affine transformation
              followed by iterative non-rigid registrations, and the virtual
              insect brain (VIB) protocol employing local non-rigid
              transformations after global and local rigid transformations.
              Quantitative analysis of the 20 brains revealed that volumes of
              the accessory medulla are directly correlated with the volumes of
              the medulla, the protocerebral bridge, and the upper division of
              the central body, suggesting functional connections among these
              neuropils. For a standardized reconstruction of the circadian

              neurons in the standard cockroach brain. The registration
              revealed that two PDF-ir arborization areas in the brain are
              highly interconnected with other PDF-ir projection sites and

              reinforce memories of unique valence and provide state-dependent
              motivational control [1]. Prior studies suggest that the
              compartment architecture of the mushroom body (MB) is the
              relevant resolution for distinct DAN functions [2, 3]. Here we
              used a recent electron microscope volume of the fly brain [4] to
              reconstruct the fine anatomy of individual DANs within three MB
              compartments. We find the 20 DANs of the $\gamma$5 compartment,
              at least some of which provide reward teaching signals, can be
              clustered into 5 anatomical subtypes that innervate different
              regions within $\gamma$5. Reconstructing 821 upstream neurons
              reveals input selectivity, supporting the functional relevance of
              DAN sub-classification. Only one PAM-$\gamma$5 DAN subtype
              $\gamma$5(fb) receives direct recurrent feedback from
              $\gamma$5$\beta$'2a mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and
              behavioral experiments distinguish a role for these DANs in
              memory revaluation from those reinforcing sugar memory. Other DAN
              subtypes receive major, and potentially reinforcing, inputs from
              putative gustatory interneurons or lateral horn neurons, which
              can also relay indirect feedback from MBONs. We similarly
              reconstructed the single aversively reinforcing
              PPL1-$\gamma$1pedc DAN. The $\gamma$1pedc DAN inputs mostly
              differ from those of $\gamma$5 DANs and they cluster onto
              distinct dendritic branches, presumably separating its
              established roles in aversive reinforcement and appetitive
              motivation [5, 6]. Tracing also identified neurons that provide
              broad input to $\gamma$5, $\beta$'2a, and $\gamma$1pedc DANs,

              effect, with a substantial decline in dendritic neuropil from the
              younger (50 years) group, especially in spine measures, which
              decreased almost 50\%. 3) Dendritic values were relatively stable
              after 40 years of age, suggesting that dendritic/spine
              degeneration in older, relatively healthy individuals may not be
              an inevitable consequence of the aging process. These findings

              cortex the axon of a neuron in layer III descended to layer VI,
              providing a columnar arborization. The axon formed specialized,
              10-50 microns long terminal segments invariably oriented parallel
              with the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells. All 85
              identified symmetrical-type synaptic contacts, deriving from 31
              specialized terminal segments, were found exclusively on the axon
              initial segment of pyramidal neurons. Rare, lone boutons of
              axo-axonic cells also made synaptic contact only with axon
              initial segments, confirming the exclusive target specificity of
              these cells. In identified gold-toned boutons, flattened
              pleomorphic vesicles were present. Electron-microscopy showed
              that axons ending in specialized terminal segments may originate
              from myelinated fibres, indicating that Golgi impregnation has
              revealed only part of the axon. Counting of axon terminal
              segments, each of which was in contact with the axon initial
              segment of a pyramidal neuron, revealed 166 pyramidal neurons
              receiving input from a partially reconstructed axo-axonic cell in
              the motor cortex of the kitten, and 67 from another cell in the
              visual cortex of the cat. The convergence of five axo-axonic
              cells onto one pyramidal cell was demonstrated in the striate
              cortex of the cat by counting all synaptic contacts on three
              initial segments. Cells from a one-month-old kitten were compared
              with those of the adult. The axon of the developing neurons was
              more diverse, having many growth cones and filopodia which made
              no specialized membrane contacts. However, the developing
              specific terminal segments formed synapses only with axon initial
              segments. It is concluded that the presence of axo-axonic cells
              in all the species and cortical areas we have examined suggests
              their association with the structural design of pyramidal cells,
              wherever the latter occur, and with their participation in the
              information processing of pyramidal cells. Axo-axonic cells are
              uniquely endowed with the means of simultaneously influencing the
              action potential at the site of origin in groups of pyramidal
              cells...",

               subsequently avoid females that are of the same age as the

               associate volatile appetitive and aversive pheromonal cues and

               learning with mated females is (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate

               or from mated female or male extracts) in the context of female
               pheromone, they develop a generalized suppression of courtship.
               The effects of cVA on initial courtship of virgin females can be
               blocked by expression of tetanus toxin in Or65a, but not Or67d
               neurons, demonstrating that the aversive effects of this
               pheromone are mediated by a specific class of olfactory neuron.
               These findings suggest that transfer of cVA to females during

              entrance of the antennal nerve, are devoted to information about
              female-produced substances whereas a set of more numerous
              ordinary glomeruli (OG) receives input about general odorants.
              Heliothine moths are particularly suitable for studying central
              chemosensory mechanisms not only because of their anatomically
              separated systems for plant odors and pheromones but also due to
              their use of female-produced substances in communication across
              the species. Thus, the male-specific system of heliothine moths
              includes two sub-arrangements, one ensuring attraction and mating
              behavior by carrying information about pheromones released by
              conspecifics, and the other inhibition of attraction via signal
              information emitted from heterospecifics. Based on previous
              tracing experiments, a general chemotopic organization of the
              male-specific glomeruli has been demonstrated in a number of
              heliothine species. As compared to the well explored organization
              of the moth antennal lobe (AL), demonstrating a non-overlapping
              representation of the biologically relevant stimuli, less is
              known about the neural arrangement residing at the following
              synaptic level, i.e., the mushroom body calyces and the lateral
              horn. In the study presented here, we have labeled
              physiologically characterized antennal-lobe projection neurons in
              males of the two heliothine species, Heliothis virescens and
              Helicoverpa assulta, for the purpose of mapping their target
              regions in the protocerebrum. In order to compare the
              representation of plant odors, pheromones, and interspecific
              signals in the higher brain regions of each species, we have
              created standard brain atlases and registered three-dimensional

              Because DNs arise from multiple circuits in the brain, the
              numerical simplicity and availability of genetic tools make
              Drosophila a tractable model for understanding descending motor
              control. As a first step towards a comprehensive study of
              descending motor control, here we estimate the number and
              distribution of DNs in the Drosophila brain. We labeled DNs by
              backfilling them with dextran dye applied to the neck connective
              and estimated that there are ~1100 DNs distributed in 6 clusters
              in Drosophila. To assess the distribution of DNs by
              neurotransmitters, we labeled DNs in flies in which neurons
              expressing the major neurotransmitters were also labeled. We
              found DNs belonging to every neurotransmitter class we tested:
              acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine and
              octopamine. Both the major excitatory neurotransmitter
              (acetylcholine) and the major inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA)
              are employed equally; this stands in contrast to vertebrate DNs
              which are predominantly excitatory. By comparing the distribution
              of DNs in Drosophila to those reported previously in other
              insects, we conclude that the organization of DNs in insects is

              to generate a large number of precisely addressable locations for

              control principles. Here we fill this gap by applying a control
              framework to the connectome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans, allowing us to predict the involvement of each C.
              elegans neuron in locomotor behaviours. We predict that control
              of the muscles or motor neurons requires 12 neuronal classes,
              which include neuronal groups previously implicated in locomotion
              by laser ablation, as well as one previously uncharacterized

              movements, whereas ablations of DD02 or DD03 do not. Our

              representation, which would allow to effectively grow
              increasingly complex networks for increasingly complex tasks. In

              respect to the number of inputs. We also evolve scalable and
              modular weightless recurrent networks capable of autonomous
              learning in a simple generic classification task. The encoding is
              very flexible and we demonstrate this by evolving networks
              capable of learning via neuromodulation. Finally, we evolve
              modular solutions to the retina problem, for which another well
              known neuroevolution method-HyperNEAT-was previously shown to
              fail. The proposed encoding outperformed HyperNEAT and Cellular
              Encoding also in another experiment, in which certain
              connectivity patterns must be discovered between layers.
              Therefore we conclude the proposed encoding is an interesting and
              competitive approach to evolve networks.",

  abstract = "The fly olfactory system has a three-layer architecture: The
              fly's olfactory receptor neurons send odor information to the
              first layer (the encoder) where this information is formatted as
              combinatorial odor code, one which is maximally informative, with
              the most informative neurons firing fastest. This first layer
              then sends the encoded odor information to the second layer
              (decoder), which consists of about 2,000 neurons that receive the
              odor information and ``break'' the code. For each odor, the
              amplitude of the synaptic odor input to the 2,000 second-layer
              neurons is approximately normally distributed across the
              population, which means that only a very small fraction of
              neurons receive a large input. Each odor, however, activates its
              own population of large-input neurons and so a small subset of
              the 2,000 neurons serves as a unique tag for the odor. Strong
              inhibition prevents most of the second-stage neurons from firing
              spikes, and therefore spikes from only the small population of
              large-input neurons is relayed to the third stage. This selected
              population provides the third stage (the user) with an odor label

              understudied region in the insect brain plays a role in
              processing both types of stimuli. The lateral horn is a higher
              order processing center that mainly processes olfactory
              information and is linked via olfactory projection neurons to
              another higher order learning center, the mushroom body. This

              functional studies have been performed. We discuss connectivity
              between the primary olfactory center, the antennal lobe, and the
              lateral horn and mushroom body. We also present evidence for the
              lateral horn playing roles in innate behavioral responses by
              encoding biological valence to novel odor cues and in learned
              responses to previously encountered odors by modulating neural

              behavioral hierarchy, in which one behavior will take precedence
              over others (Davis, 1985). Most experimental work on the neuronal
              basis of decision-making has focussed on the latter of these: a

              basis for this hierarchy, hypothesized to depend on inhibitory

              particular, we present a detailed description of the

              neuroectoderm and in the neuroblast layer of the gap genes empty

              the homeotic gene labial; the early eye genes dachshund, eyeless

              that it is possible to follow the fate of individual neuroblasts

              Interneurons of the Drosophila Antennal Lobe",
  author   = "Nagel, Katherine I and Wilson, Rachel I",
  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Local inhibitory neurons control the timing of neural
              activity in many circuits. To understand how inhibition controls
              timing, it is important to understand the dynamics of activity in
              populations of local inhibitory interneurons, as well as the
              mechanisms that underlie these dynamics. Here we describe the in
              vivo response dynamics of a large population of inhibitory local
              neurons (LNs) in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe, the
              analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb, and we dissect the
              network and intrinsic mechanisms that give rise to these
              dynamics. Some LNs respond to odor onsets (``ON'' cells) and
              others to offsets (``OFF'' cells), whereas still others respond
              at both times. Moreover, different LNs signal odor concentration
              fluctuations on different timescales. Some respond rapidly, and
              can track rapid concentration fluctuations. Others respond
              slowly, and are best at tracking slow fluctuations. We found a
              continuous spectrum of preferred stimulation timescales among
              LNs, as well as a continuum of ON-OFF behavior. Using in vivo
              whole-cell recordings, we show that the timing of an LN's
              response (ON vs OFF) can be predicted from the interplay of
              excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents that it receives.
              Meanwhile, the preferred timescale of an LN is related to its
              intrinsic properties. These results illustrate how a population
              of inhibitory interneurons can collectively encode bidirectional
              changes in stimulus intensity on multiple timescales, and how
              this can arise via an interaction between synaptic and intrinsic
              mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Most neural circuits contain
              diverse populations of inhibitory interneurons. The way
              inhibition shapes network activity will depend on the spiking
              dynamics of the interneuron population. Here we describe the
              dynamics of activity in a large population of inhibitory
              interneurons in the first brain relay of the fruit fly olfactory
              system. Because odor plumes fluctuate on multiple timescales, the
              drive to this circuit can vary over a range of frequencies. We
              show how synaptic and cellular mechanisms interact to recruit
              different interneurons at different times, and in response to
              different temporal features of odor stimuli. As a result,
              inhibition is recruited over a range of conditions, and there is
              the potential to tune the timing of inhibition as the environment
              changes.",

  abstract = "In the Drosophila embryo, studies on CNS development have so far
              mainly focused on the relatively simply structured ventral nerve
              cord. In the trunk, proneural genes become expressed in small
              cell clusters at specific positions of the ventral neuroectoderm.
              A lateral inhibition process mediated by the neurogenic genes
              ensures that only one cell within each proneural cluster
              delaminates as a neural stem cell (neuroblast). Thus, a fixed
              number of neuroblasts is formed, according to a stereotypical
              spatiotemporal and segmentally repeated pattern, each
              subsequently generating a specific cell lineage. Owing to higher
              complexity and hidden segmental organisation, the mechanisms
              underlying the development of the brain are much less understood.
              In order to pave the way towards gaining deeper insight into
              these mechanisms, we have undertaken a comprehensive survey of
              early brain development until embryonic stage 11, when all brain
              neuroblasts have formed. We describe the complete spatiotemporal
              pattern of formation of about 100 brain neuroblasts on either
              side building the trito-, deuto- and protocerebrum. Using
              4D-microscopy, we have uncovered various modes of neuroblast
              formation that are related to specific mitotic domains of the
              procephalic neuroectoderm. Furthermore, a detailed description is
              provided of the dynamic expression patterns of proneural genes
              (achaete, scute, lethal of scute, atonal) in the procephalic

              direct evidence that, in contrast to the trunk, adjacent cells
              within specific domains of the procephalic neuroectoderm develop
              as neuroblasts, indicating that mechanisms controlling neuroblast
              formation differ between head and trunk.",

              phylum Placozoa, one of the earliest-diverging metazoan phyla. It
              is a small disk-shaped animal that glides on surfaces in warm
              oceans to feed on algae. Prior anatomical studies of Trichoplax
              revealed that it has a simple three-layered organization with
              four somatic cell types. RESULTS: We reinvestigate the cellular
              organization of Trichoplax using advanced freezing and microscopy
              techniques to identify localize and count cells. Six somatic cell
              types are deployed in stereotyped positions. A thick ventral
              plate, comprising the majority of the cells, includes ciliated
              epithelial cells, newly identified lipophil cells packed with
              large lipid granules, and gland cells. Lipophils project deep
              into the interior, where they alternate with regularly spaced
              fiber cells whose branches contact all other cell types,
              including cells of the dorsal and ventral epithelium. Crystal
              cells, each containing a birefringent crystal, are arrayed around
              the rim. Gland cells express several proteins typical of
              neurosecretory cells, and a subset of them, around the rim, also
              expresses an FMRFamide-like neuropeptide. CONCLUSIONS: Structural
              analysis of Trichoplax with significantly improved techniques
              provides an advance in understanding its cell types and their
              distributions. We find two previously undetected cell types,
              lipohil and crystal cells, and an organized body plan in which
              different cell types are arranged in distinct patterns. The
              composition of gland cells suggests that they are neurosecretory

              preparations. Realistic models of the structural relationships
              between neurons require a common framework. Here we present 3-D
              reconstructions of single projection neurons (PN) connecting the
              antennal lobe (AL) with the mushroom body (MB) and lateral horn,
              groups of intrinsic mushroom body neurons (type 5 Kenyon cells),
              and a single mushroom body extrinsic neuron (PE1), aiming to
              compose components of the olfactory pathway in the honeybee. To
              do so, we constructed a digital standard atlas of the bee brain.
              The standard atlas was created as an average-shape atlas of 22
              neuropils, calculated from 20 individual immunostained
              whole-mount bee brains. After correction for global size and
              positioning differences by repeatedly applying an intensity-based
              nonrigid registration algorithm, a sequence of average label
              images was created. The results were qualitatively evaluated by
              generating average gray-value images corresponding to the average
              label images and judging the level of detail within the labeled
              regions. We found that the first affine registration step in the
              sequence results in a blurred image because of considerable local
              shape differences. However, already the first nonrigid iteration
              in the sequence corrected for most of the shape differences among
              individuals, resulting in images rich in internal detail. A
              second iteration improved on that somewhat and was selected as
              the standard. Registering neurons from different preparations
              into the standard atlas reveals 1) that the m-ACT neuron occupies
              the entire glomerulus (cortex and core) and overlaps with a local
              interneuron in the cortical layer; 2) that, in the MB calyces and
              the lateral horn of the protocerebral lobe, the axon terminals of
              two identified m-ACT neurons arborize in separate but close areas
              of the neuropil; and 3) that MB-intrinsic clawed Kenyon cells
              (type 5), with somata outside the calycal cups, project to the
              peduncle and lobe output system of the MB and contact (proximate)
              the dendritic tree of the PE1 neuron at the base of the vertical
              lobe. Thus the standard atlas and the procedures applied for
              registration serve the function of creating realistic

              neurons forming a deep core cortex, surrounded at the surface by
              approximately 100 secondary lineages. Each secondary lineage
              forms a tract (secondary lineage tract) with an invariant and
              characteristic trajectory. Within the neuropile, tracts of
              neighboring lineages bundle together to form secondary tract
              systems. In this paper, we visualized secondary lineages by the
              global marker BP106 (neurotactin), as well as green fluorescent
              protein-labeled clones and thereby establish a comprehensive
              digital atlas of secondary lineages. The information contained in
              this atlas is the location of the lineage within the cortex, the
              neuropile compartment contacted by the lineage tract, and the
              projection pattern of the lineage tract within the neuropile. We
              have digitally mapped the expression pattern of three genes, sine

              our lineage atlas, which visualizes all wild-type lineages, will

              thought to be coded by two types of neurons: mushroom body output
              neurons (MBONs) and lateral horn (LH) neurons. MBONs are
              classified as neurons that promote either attraction or aversion,
              but not both, and they are dynamically activated by upstream
              neurons. This dynamic activation updates the valence values. In
              contrast, LH neurons receive scaled, but non-dynamic, input from
              their upstream neurons. It remains unclear how such a non-dynamic
              system generates differential valence values. Recently, PD2a1/b1

              their effect on valence can change. Taken together, we suggest

              which fate these progenitors acquire in adult tissues requires
              the simultaneous measurement of clonal history and cell identity
              at single-cell resolution, which has been a major challenge.
              Clonal history has traditionally been investigated by
              microscopically tracking cells during development, monitoring the
              heritable expression of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins
              and, more recently, using next-generation sequencing technologies
              that exploit somatic mutations, microsatellite instability,
              transposon tagging, viral barcoding, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
              and Cre-loxP recombination. Single-cell transcriptomics provides
              a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here
              we present ScarTrace, a single-cell sequencing strategy that
              enables the simultaneous quantification of clonal history and
              cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs

              cells in the kidney marrow, and that many progenitors produce
              specific cell types in the eyes and brain. In addition, we study
              when embryonic progenitors commit to the left or right eye.
              ScarTrace reveals that epidermal and mesenchymal cells in the
              caudal fin arise from the same progenitors, and that
              osteoblast-restricted precursors can produce mesenchymal cells
              during regeneration. Furthermore, we identify resident immune
              cells in the fin with a distinct clonal origin from other blood
              cell types. We envision that similar approaches will have major
              applications in other experimental systems, in which the matching
              of embryonic clonal origin to adult cell type will ultimately

              the number of odours that can be detected and the apparently
              simple systems of detection and processing available to larvae.
              Molecular biological techniques in both neuroanatomy and cell
              biology have made it possible to begin to resolve some of these
              problems, if data from a wide range of studies are integrated.
              Four sectors of research on a large number of species are
              reviewed: the behaviour involved in the olfactory response, the
              wide range of odours that can be detected, the neuroanatomical
              basis of olfaction in cyclorrhaphous larvae and the number of
              receptors involved in detecting these odours. Finally, a
              neuroanatomical model of olfactory processing is presented,
              together with perspectives for future research, emphasising the
              importance of studying the ecology of the species under
              investigation.",

              have suggested that memory is consolidated from an initial,
              disruptable form into a long-lasting, stable form within a few
              hours after training. We combined these traditional approaches
              with genetic analyses in Drosophila to show that consolidated
              memory of conditioned (learned) odor avoidance 1 day after
              extended training consisted of two genetically distinct,
              functionally independent memory components: anesthesia-resistant
              memory (ARM) and long-term memory (LTM). ARM decayed away within
              4 days, was resistant to hypothermic disruption, was insensitive
              to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CXM), and was
              disrupted by the radish single-gene mutation. LTM showed no
              appreciable decay over 7 days, was sensitive to CXM, and was not
              disrupted by the radish mutation.",

  abstract = "We investigated decision-making in the leech nervous system by
              stimulating identical sensory inputs that sometimes elicit
              crawling and other times swimming. Neuronal populations were
              monitored with voltage-sensitive dyes after each stimulus. By
              quantifying the discrimination time of each neuron, we found
              single neurons that discriminate before the two behaviors are
              evident. We used principal component analysis and linear
              discriminant analysis to find populations of neurons that
              discriminated earlier than any single neuron. The analysis
              highlighted the neuron cell 208. Hyperpolarizing cell 208 during
              a stimulus biases the leech to swim; depolarizing it biases the
              leech to crawl or to delay swimming.",

@ARTICLE{Olsen2010-lc,
  title    = "Divisive normalization in olfactory population codes",
  author   = "Olsen, Shawn R and Bhandawat, Vikas and Wilson, Rachel I",
  abstract = "In many regions of the visual system, the activity of a neuron is
              normalized by the activity of other neurons in the same region.
              Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory
              processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the
              orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate
              feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons
              (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward
              input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization
              scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron
              (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN
              responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two
              variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately
              predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination
              by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary
              transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each
              processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps
              equalize responses to different stimuli. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

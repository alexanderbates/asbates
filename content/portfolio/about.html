<p>I am a neuroscientist and small-time programmer. I work on insect brains. I am interested in how neurons wire together, and how they work together to build complex, innate behaviours. Learn <a href="https://asbates/about">more about me here</a>.</p>
<p>Originally from London, once of Cambridge, currently in Boston. I like to collaborate and exchange. This website exists to help you get to know science-me and vinegar fly brains.</p>
<p>“But - I thought flies didn’t have brains?” ~ Joan Bates, Grandmother, circa. Summer 2016</p>

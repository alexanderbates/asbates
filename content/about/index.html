<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BOVTiXIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">I am a neuroscientist</a> studying the neurobiology of animal navigation in the <a href="https://wilson.hms.harvard.edu/">Wilson lab</a> at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a> since March 2021. The animal I study is the vinegar fly, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. I used to build connectomics tools and analyses for synaptic-resolution data sets for this little fly in my previous life as <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> PhD student at the <a href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/">MRC LMB</a>, in the group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Jefferis">Greg Jefferis</a>, and still do sometimes. I have a whole <a href="https://t.co/TzCi2OPViD?amp=1">thesis</a> on the matter. I have also lead a scientific student magazine, <a href="https://www.bluesci.co.uk/">BlueSci</a>, and once hoped to be an author of something other than <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_mandates&amp;hl=en&amp;user=BOVTiXIAAAAJ&amp;tzom=240">scientific papers</a>; I still hope that a bit.</p>

<p>I am interested in the structure of small brains. I think that we will be able to learn more about how a nervous system can control its flesh bot from tiny things, than we will from bigger things like mammals. At the moment, I am interested in trying to make in roads starting from the connectomes our field has striven to hard to build. Right now, this means I am trying to interpret navigational circuitry and predict what it does, testing these predictions using a course of behavioural and physiological experimentation. I aim to manipulate and record single cell types from the connectome - single nodes on the grand connectomic graph - while flies are stable and behaving in virtual reality.</p>

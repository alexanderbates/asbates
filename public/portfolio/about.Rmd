I am a neuroscientist and small-time programmer. I work on insect brains. I am interested in how neurons wire together, and how they work together to build complex, innate behaviours. Learn [more about me here](https://asbates/about).

```{r wordcloud, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(PubMedWordcloud)
pmids1 = getPMIDs(author = "Alexander Shakeel Bates", dFrom = 2007, dTo = 2050, n = 100)
pmids2 = getPMIDs(author = "Alexander S Bates", dFrom = 2007, dTo = 2050, n = 100)
pmids = union(pmids1,pmids2)
abstracts = getAbstracts(pmids)
cleanAbs = invisible(cleanAbstracts(abstracts))
plotWordCloud(cleanAbs)
```
